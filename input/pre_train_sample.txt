NSW	New South Wales	In NSW 41% of males and 34% of females aged 16--24 report drinking at levels that pose a lifetime risk to their health.
GST	Goods and Services Tax	The mixing of alcohol with familiar sweet tastes such as cola or fruit juices has been shown to improve the appeal of alcoholic drinks to young people, facilitate premature consumption of alcohol and encourage increased volume of alcohol consumption \[[@CR6]\].The alcopops tax was introduced in response to concerns about the explosive growth in sales and consumption of RTDs that had occurred in Australia since July 2000 when tax reform involving the introduction of a GST left RTDs taxed at 40% less per litre of alcohol compared with straight spirits.
EDs	emergency departments	However, no studies have examined the longer term impact of the tax on alcohol consumption, and limited evidence has emerged as to whether this specific taxation measure reduced rates of alcohol-related harm in young people as was intended.To address this evidence gap, this study estimates the impact of changes in alcohol taxation on presentations for acute alcohol problems to hospital EDs in NSW.Methods {#Sec2}=======Data sources {#Sec3}------------The Emergency Department Data Collection (EDDC) of the NSW Ministry of Health is the largest database of ED presentations in Australia.

GoLife	Genealogy of Life program	In cases in which it is not clear whether a set of hybrid organisms represents a clade (as opposed to independently produced hybrid individuals that do not form a clade), authors should consider whether a name is really needed, bearing in mind that formulae, though more cumbersome, are more informative.In many ways, the sentiments expressed here about phylogenetics are the same as those engendered in the recent announcement of the NSF GoLife (see NSF and reticulating phylogenies) — a genealogy does not have to be tree-like.CommentsIn one sense, we should applaud the creators of the Phylocode for explicitly addressing an issue that has traditionally been ignored by the creators of the other codes (who have ignored phylogeny), as well as by tree-based phylogeneticists (who seem to think that phylogenies consist only of nested monophyletic groups).Previous suggestions for dealing with hybrids look a bit like an attempt to sweep all of the problems together into separate piles, and then simply labeling them "problem piles" (see How should we treat hybrids in a taxonomic scheme?).

LL	leading logarithmic	In determining the leading contribution to the cross section for the high-energy scattering of two objects with transverse scales $k_1^2$ and $k_2^2$, one resums terms of the form $$\left(\as \ln \frac{s}{s_0} \right)^n.$$ At LL (in $x$) order, the choice of $s_0$ is immaterial.
NLL	next-to-leading logarithmic	When one starts to consider NLL terms, $$\as \left(\as \ln \frac{s}{s_0} \right)^n,$$ one sees that their form will depend on the choice made for $s_0$ in the LL terms.

ISM	interstellar medium	The most recent model of @wang15 includes $4\,\mkm$ clean water ice particles and does explain both mid-IR extinction and the abundance of oxygen in dust, but the ice particles hardly can be so large and clean in the ISM.In this paper, we analyze a large set of dust models, concentrating on variations of grain structure and a proper presentation of grains’ chemical composition, to find a model that fits the near- and mid-IR extinctions and the 10 $\mkm$ feature observed to the GC.
Si	silicate	Hence, the data can be combined, and the question on where is located the dust that produces the extinction is not as important as it could be.We base our analysis on the model of @hv14 who chose the initial size distributions of and carbonaceous dust that fited the mean Milky Way extinction curve with $R_V=3.1$ [@wd01] and considered dust grain size evolution due to the accretion and coagulation processes.So, our model contains two populations of grains: Si and carbonaceous (C) ones[^3] with the size distributions from @hv14.

MS	multiple sclerosis	Introduction {#s1}============Each year, MS affects \~2.0 million people worldwide, resulting in \~20,000 deaths from this disease ([@B1]).
CNS	central nervous system	MS is a CNS degenerative disease with autoimmune demyelination and progressive CNS degeneration.
RRMS	relapsing-remitting MS	Consistent with this possibility, we found both remitting and progressive processes in an animal model of RRMS ([@B6]).
PP	primary progressive	With regard to progressive MS, clinical studies have also shown that PP MS patients have an impaired ability to use newly learned information ([@B11]), cognitive decline over time ([@B7]), and lesions in clinically silent CNS regions ([@B12], [@B13]).
LTP	long-term potentiation	First, chronic destruction of myelin caused by activated microglia at these cortical sites might indeed promote progressive cognitive losses because myelin debris alters LTP ([@B20]).
MS	multiple sclerosis	Holding back progressive MS requires therapeutics within a time-sensitive window during the disease process.
NMDA	N-methyl-D-aspartate	Several studies have shown that neurodegeneration can be caused by a synaptic transmission ratio that has been altered due to various factors present during CNS degenerative diseases ([@B32], [@B33]).Overactivation of * NMDA and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate causes neuronal damage; whereas beneficial effects are obtained by targeting these receptors in animal models of MS. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter.
AMPA	amino-3-hydroxy-5methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid	Several studies have shown that neurodegeneration can be caused by a synaptic transmission ratio that has been altered due to various factors present during CNS degenerative diseases ([@B32], [@B33]).Overactivation of *N*-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and α- AMPA receptors by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate causes neuronal damage; whereas beneficial effects are obtained by targeting these receptors in animal models of MS. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter.
GABA	gamma-aminobutyric acid	For example, the use of memantine that acts on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors caused neurological impairment in MS patients, although the impairment is reversible ([@B32], [@B39]).Regarding the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, treatments that target the GABAergic system delay development of EAE disease and decrease EAE severity ([@B32], [@B38]).
IL1	interleukin 1	Among inflammatory cytokines, IL1 alters the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic transmission during inflammatory demyelination ([@B44]).
NO	nitric oxide	Other factors secreted by T-cells such as NO and osteopontin have similar deleterious effects ([@B47]).
TWIK	two-pore domain weakly inward-rectifying K channel	Potassium channels are present on T-cells, so blocking TWIK-related acid-sensitive K+ channel 1 (TASK1) also leads to less T-cell proliferation and reduced proinflammatory cytokines, which all have beneficial effects on neurons ([@B59], [@B60]) (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}).!
MS	multiple sclerosis	A wide range of pharmacological targets has been used to treat MS.
CNS	central nervous system	The many targets have addressed the multifaceted aspect of this disease, which include both inflammation and CNS cells, including neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes.
FDA	Food and Drug Administration	Fingolimod (FTY720), the first US FDA-approved oral medication for MS, increases neural stem cell survival and enhances their development into mature oligodendrocytes (OLGs) ([@B73]), with benefits for myelin repair.
OLGs	oligodendrocytes	Fingolimod (FTY720), the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral medication for MS, increases neural stem cell survival and enhances their development into mature OLGs ([@B73]), with benefits for myelin repair.
LacCer	lactosylceramide	At the same time, during the progressive stage of MS, selected astrocytes express LacCer, which recruits inflammatory monocytes from the blood ([@B105]).
NGF	nerve growth factor	Targeting NGF has been proposed to induce neuroprotection in MS ([@B108]).
BDNF	brain-derived neurotrophic factor	Furthermore, BDNF has been reported to increase upon Glatiramer acetate treatment during developmental myelination, with positive effects on myelination ([@B106]).
FAS	first apoptosis signal receptor	Protection from cell death could be obtained by using pharmacological inhibitors of FAS and TNF-dependent apoptosis ([@B112]).Others------An aberrant immune response is believed to give rise to MS, both for the remitting and progressive forms ([@B113]).
AHSCT	autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant	 AHSCT is one such treatment ([@B114]).
DHODH	dihydroorotate dehydrogenase	Teriflunomide primarily acts as an inhibitor of DHODH, a key mitochondrial enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines in rapidly proliferating cells such as T- and B-lymphocytes, thereby diminishing the inflammatory response to auto-antigens ([@B137]).
MS	multiple sclerosis	Of interest in the context of progressive MS, recent drugs include ocrelizumab, which depletes B-cells; fluoxetine, which regulates astrocytes and microglia; and Ibudilast and biotin.
SHFM	split-hand/split-foot malformation	Hence, isolated SHFM was diagnosed and amniocentesis was offered after detailed counseling regarding the syndrome, its prognosis and the role of genetic analyses.
aCGH	array comparative genomic hybridization	QF-PCR analysis for detection of common aneuploidies of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y (ABI^®^PRISM 3130xl, Life Technologies) and (aCGH; microarray 8X60K G3 ISCA V2; CytoGenomics software; Agilent Technologies) revealed a male genomic pattern, without aneuploidies or chromosomal imbalances.
EEC	ectodermal dysplasia cleft lip/palate syndrome	In the present case, accurate genetic diagnosis, allowed focused genetic and reproductive counseling, including detailed discussion of the option of *in vitro* fertilization and preimplantation genetic diagnosis for embryo selection in future pregnancies.In the present study, aCGH was advised since ectrodactyly may be sometimes associated with certain genetic defects, including ectrodactyly EEC and Cornelia de Lange syndrome.

ACS	Access Control	We will also need to secure a set of web APIs using some sort of OAuth mechanism, so the user would possibly create an account on the web app and then create an application which would give them the keys they need to access the API from their own app.We have a basic portal app using MVC 4 and DotNetOpenAuth which allows a user to create an account and login with either a username and password or their Google, Facebook account etc.The APIs would be MVC 4 Web APIsIdeally the whole set up needs to be as simple as possible, I've briefly looked into using Windows Azure ACS as a way to cut out some of the heavy lifting but its hard to tell where exactly it all fits together.Currently we run an ADFS 2.0 server and WIF to allow web login to our apps but it doesn't seem like it would be an ideal choice when integrating the social login and for securing the web APIsI guess it could be two quite seperate parts, once they are logged into the portal, how would we go about providing some sort of claims token to the other apps they then access to understand who the user is and what they are allowed to do.

PC	principal component	Based on the largely strong correlations between BBS, 10 m walking test, POMA, TUG, CRT, and CTSIB we used a PC analysis to condense these functional tests (FT) into one variable (PC-FT).Concerning PROs, we noted significant correlations between FFb-H-R, which represents the center of PROs' correlations and reflects many different aspects of patient-reported functional impairments, and pain intensity during stress as well as max.

Td	time delay	However, Td extracted from the model-based approach did not differ between groups, highlighting the assumption that altered PHASE behavior as a function of time is not primarily caused by physiological impairments but rather by a compensation strategy, ie altered timing for stance regulation.Additionally, the model-based total effort to correct the difference between actual and desired body angle (represented by the model parameter Kp) was similar in both groups, indicating that the intensity of motor response was also not unaltered in LSS patients.
FFb-H-R	from perturbed stance significantly correlate with both patient-reported functional outcomes	In contrast, measures FFb-H-R and specific functional tests, which in turn correlated strongly.
PC-FT	perturbed stance, many functional tests	We claim that the close correlation between our experimental results from PC-FT, and the patient-reported deficits may be applied in future to lower the number of tests necessary to accurately assess all facets of postural impairments.In general, our data lead us to conclude that patients' postural reactions following external perturbations are suitable to precisely quantify most of their postural impairments unlike spontaneous sway measures.

cDCs	conventional or myeloid DCs	Under non-inflammatory conditions, bone marrow-derived DC progenitors give rise to developmentally distinct DC subsets that can be identified on a transcriptomic and phenotypic basis and that consist of two subsets of cDCs and one subset of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) ([@B1]--[@B3]).
pDCs	plasmacytoid DCs	Under non-inflammatory conditions, bone marrow-derived DC progenitors give rise to developmentally distinct DC subsets that can be identified on a transcriptomic and phenotypic basis and that consist of two subsets of conventional (or myeloid) DCs (cDCs) and one subset of pDCs ([@B1]--[@B3]).
Th1	T helper 1	They play a crucial role in immune responses against intracellular pathogens and cancer, mainly related to their intrinsic ability to efficiently up-take and cross-present antigens, and to activate Th1 and cytotoxic T cell responses ([@B4], [@B6], [@B7]).
moDCs	monocyte-derived DCs	Although their ontology is difficult to address in humans, transcriptomic analyses suggest that inflammatory DCs derive from monocytes rather than from DC precursors ([@B7], [@B13], [@B14]), monocyte differentiation into moDCs being driven by the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ([@B15]).
slan	sulfo LacNAc	Inflammatory DCs also include a small population of 6- slan-positive cells ([@B2], [@B7]).
PD-L1	programmed death-ligand 1	As the knowledge on the expression of immune checkpoints on human DCs is only fragmentary at present, mapping the expression of these inhibitory molecules on DC subsets at rest and upon exposure to different conditions represents the first step in this direction.Therefore, in this study we investigated the expression of three immune checkpoints, namely PD-L1, immunoglobulin-like transcript 2 (ILT2), and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3) on peripheral blood DC subsets, in basal conditions and upon exposure to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory stimuli.
ILT2	immunoglobulin-like transcript 2	As the knowledge on the expression of immune checkpoints on human DCs is only fragmentary at present, mapping the expression of these inhibitory molecules on DC subsets at rest and upon exposure to different conditions represents the first step in this direction.Therefore, in this study we investigated the expression of three immune checkpoints, namely programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), ILT2, and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3) on peripheral blood DC subsets, in basal conditions and upon exposure to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory stimuli.

MDS	myelodysplastic syndrome	In order to test the newly developed panel with the characterization of DCs in a pathologic context, we further applied our 18-color method to the study of peripheral blood DCs in patients affected by MDS, a heterogeneous group of haematopoietic neoplasms characterized by ineffective haemopoiesis and progression to acute myeloid leukemia in a third of patients ([@B27]).
IRB	Institutional Review Board	The study protocol was approved by the IRB of Humanitas Research Hospital (ONC-OSS-04-2017; 29/18).
mAbs	monoclonal antibodies	Incubation with IL-10 was performed by adding IL-10 (recombinant human IL-10; 40 ng/ml; Peprotech, London, UK) either alone or in combination with LPS or IMQ.Sample Staining---------------At the end of the culture, WB samples (500 μl) were stained with an 18-color flow cytometry panel of mAbs as described below.
FCS	Flow Cytometry Standard	 FCS 3.0 files were imported into FlowJo software version 9.9.6 (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, Oregon), and data were compensated by using single-stained antibody-capture beads (CompBeads, BD Biosciences), as previously described ([@B36]).
FSc	forward scatter	Because peripheral blood DCs are characterized by FSc similar to monocytes and side scatter (SSc) similar to lymphocytes, an acquisition gate was established based on FSc and SSc that included both lymphocytes and monocytes (mononuclear cells) but excluded most granulocytes and debris.

PD-1	programmed death-1	In the case of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, PD-L1 is a ligand of the co-inhibitory receptor PD-1 that is expressed on activated T cells and that, if engaged by its ligands, suppresses T cell function primarily by inactivating CD28 signaling ([@B47]).
TGF	tumor growth factor	In particular, relevant to the use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in cancer immunoherapy, it will be interesting to verify the differential expression of PD-L1 on DC subsets in the tumor microenvironment, which may contribute to PD-L1 upregulation on DCs through the action of various factors including IL-10, as used in our study, and TGF-β ([@B56]).Another interesting result of our study was the demonstration that cDC1s failed to express ILT2, both in unstimulated and TLR-stimulated conditions, while all the other DC subsets showed a basal expression of ILT2 that was further upregulated upon exposure to LPS and IMQ.
IRB	Institutional Review Board	Applied to the study of DCs in the tumor microenvironment, this panel has the potential to provide valuable information to be used for improving our comprehension of the role of distinct DC subsets in cancer, guiding DC-targeting immunotherapy, and possibly identifying predictive biomarkers for clinical response in cancer patients undergoing immune checkpoint blockade treatment.Ethics Statement {#s5}================This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the IRB of Humanitas Research Hospital with written informed consent from all subjects.

ISAR	inverse synthetic aperture radar	A related application is ISAR, where the receive-transmit antenna is stationary, and the synthetic aperture is due to the motion of an unknown scatterer.
flat	five variables: the location $\vy$ on the known	Backscatter reflectivities are in general functions of flat surface, the two angles of incidence and the frequency.
MMV	measurement vector	The optimization can then be carried out within the multiple MMV formalism described in [@malioutov05; @cotter2005sparse; @tropp2006algorithmsI; @tropp2006algorithmsII].The MMV formalism is used for solving matrix-matrix equations for an unknown matrix variable whose columns share the same support but have possibly different nonzero values.
MMV	measurement vector	This Multiple MMV formulation has been studied in [@eldar10; @chen06; @rao1998sparse] and has been used successfully for source localization with passive arrays of sensors in [@malioutov05] and for imaging strong scattering scenes, where multiple scattering effects cannot be neglected, in [@chai2014imaging].In the MMV framework the support of the unknown matrix ${\bf X}$ is quantified by the number of nonzero rows, that is the row-wise $\ell_0$ norm of ${\bf X}$.
MMV	measurement vector	This is done with the multiple MMV formalism, which leads to a matrix $\ell_1$ optimization problem.

BTC	Bitcoin	As of writing, that looks unlikely.A convincing move above $12,000 is needed to revive the bullish setup, as per the weekly chart. BTC risks falling back to recent lows below $9,500, having strengthened the short-term bearish case with a $700 drop earlier today.The top cryptocurrency fell from $10,843 to $10,082 in the eight hours to 07:00 UTC, confirming an end of the bounce from the Aug. 15 low of $9,467.Prices slipped into four digits on Aug. 13 and extended gains to levels above $10,900 on Monday.
MACD	moving average convergence divergence	So, a drop to $9,467 could be seen over the next couple of days.Supporting the bearish case are a below-50 reading on the relative strength index and a bearish reversal on the the MACD histogram.The outlook would turn bullish if prices rise above $11,000 in the next 24 hours, although as of writing, that looks unlikely.Daily chartOn the daily chart, the RSI remains in the bearish territory below 50.00.
May low	months.With the path of least resistance to the downside, support at $9,049	The MACD is also holding bearish below zero.Bitcoin has also found acceptance below the 5-, 10- and 50-day moving averages.So, a drop to the 100-day MA at $9,882 could be seen – a level that served as strong support on Aug. 15 and Aug. 16.A UTC close below the 100-day MA, if confirmed, would bolster the bearish setup.Weekly chartBTC’s rejection near $11,000 and the subsequent drop to $10,100 has reinforced a bearish crossover of the 5- and 10-week moving averages, currently located at $10,506 and $10,638, respectively.The MACD histogram continues to produce lower highs and is currently reporting the weakest bullish momentum in six May low stands exposed.On the higher side, a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed to revive the bullish setup.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View

α7 nAChR	α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor	\[[@R41]\] showed that Th1 cytokine IL-12 significantly decreased the protein expression of α7 nAChR, which was expressed on murine CD4+ T cells and relayed anti-inflammatory signals, while Th2 cytokine IL-4 enhanced α7 nAChR expression.
PBMCs	peripheral blood mononuclear cells	evaluated the percentage of circulating Th17 among CD3+ cells in PBMCs of psoriatic patients and found that smokers had higher levels of Th17+ T cells than non-smokers and that tobacco smoke extract enhanced Th17 generation *in vitro* \[[@R45]\].
CTLs	cytotoxic T lymphocytes	Further investigations, especially in humans, are needed to provide mechanistic insight into the effects of cigarette smoke on Th1/Th2/Th17 responses and allergy or autoimmune diseases mediated by these T helper cells.CD8^+^ T cells {#s2_3}--------------CD8^+^ T cells are also known as CTLs, which play an important role in host immune defense via killing infected or damaged cells.
aTregs	activated CD25^+++^CD45RA^−^ Tregs	The suppressive subpopulations contained both resting CD25^++^CD45RA^+^ Tregs (rTregs) and aTregs while the pro-inflammatory subpopulations were cytokine-secreting CD25^++^CD45RA^−^ (FrIII) cells \[[@R68]\].

TLRs	Toll-like receptors	The acute inflammatory responses caused by smoking was reported to depend on TLRs \[[@R98]\].
pDC	plasmacytoid DC	And CSE caused a decrease in mRNA level of TLR-7 and IRF-7 in human pDC infected by respiratory syncytial viruses, demonstrating a suppressive effect of cigarette smoke on pDC upon infection \[[@R105]\].
DCs	dendritic cells	Taken together, cigarette smoking is likely to exacerbate inflammatory responses but attenuate immune defenses against infections by regulating TLR signaling. DCs {#s3_2}---------------------DCs are derived from a hematopoietic lineage of bone narrow and can induce immune responses to pathogens via processing and presenting antigens \[[@R106]\].
LCs	Langerhans cells	Cigarette smoke alters the number, distribution and development of DCs and LCs.
CO	carbon monoxide	It was demonstrated that CSE was significantly associated with the reduced stimulating capacity of DCs in mice with asthma \[[@R110]\], and that murine DCs treated *in vitro* with CO, a component of tobacco smoke, prevented accumulation of pancreatic autoreactive CD8^+^ T cells in mice with autoimmune diabetes \[[@R111]\].
SCM	smoke-conditioned medium	Cigarette smoke was reported to suppress the expression of IFN-γ and TNF-α in human NK (CD56+CD3-) cells stimulated by poly I:C while SCM reduced the cytotoxicity of NK cells that had a lower perforin production \[[@R126], [@R127]\].

CTLs	cytotoxic T lymphocytes	Introduction {#sec1-cancers-11-00872}===============Cancer immunotherapy, which has the purpose to increase the pool of tumor-reactive CTLs, has emerged as a promising modality to treat cancer.
IFN	interferon	Cancer cells of different histology can express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274, B7-H1), either constitutively or in response to immune-derived signals such as IFN \[[@B4-cancers-11-00872],[@B5-cancers-11-00872]\].
IHC	immunohistochemical	 IHC detection of PD-L1 has been used to discern responders from non-responders across different cancer types.
SPR	surface plasmon resonance	We showed, using SPR, that sdAb K2 has a nanomolar affinity (K~D~ = 3.75 nM), close to the affinity of avelumab (K~D~ = 1.6 nM) for human PD-L1 ([Figure 1](#cancers-11-00872-f001){ref-type="fig"}A).
iTLC	instant thin layer chromatography	This resulted in a radiochemical purity of \>98% for both sdAb K2 and sdAb R3B23 as determined by iTLC.The biodistribution of sdAb K2 was first evaluated in healthy C57BL/6 mice using SPECT/CT imaging and compared to that of sdAb R3B23.
i.v.	intravenous	As can be expected from small hydrophilic proteins with fast pharmacokinetics and lack of a molecular target in naive mice, in vivo image analysis, one hour after i.v.
TCR	T cell receptor	In the same assay, the IC~50~ value of avelumab was 4 nM, whereas both controls, sdAb R3B23, and trastuzumab, did not influence the PD-1:PD-L1 interaction ([Figure 6](#cancers-11-00872-f006){ref-type="fig"}B).2.5. sdAb K2 Facilitates TCR Signaling in 2D3 Reporter Cells upon Recognition of Tumor Cells {#sec2dot5-cancers-11-00872}--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We furthermore used a cell-based assay to evaluate whether sdAb K2 is able to block the PD-1:PD-L1 pathway leading to enhanced TCR signaling.
eGFP	enhanced green fluorescent protein	When the TCR is triggered, the cells express eGFP under the control of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) promoter \[[@B25-cancers-11-00872]\].We used this platform to evaluate the blocking ability of sdAb K2, as schematized in [Figure 6](#cancers-11-00872-f006){ref-type="fig"}C,D.
NFAT	nuclear factor of activated T cells	When the TCR is triggered, the cells express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the control of the NFAT promoter \[[@B25-cancers-11-00872]\].We used this platform to evaluate the blocking ability of sdAb K2, as schematized in [Figure 6](#cancers-11-00872-f006){ref-type="fig"}C,D.
PBMCs	peripheral blood mononuclear cells	Moreover, eGFP expression of PD-1^POS^ 2D3 cells co-cultured with PD-L1^POS^ MCF7 tumor cells treated with sdAb K2 or avelumab was even higher compared to co-culturing with PD-L1^NEG^ MCF7 tumor cells (1.23 ± 0.33 for sdAb K2 and 1.28 ± 0.46 for avelumab) ([Figure 6](#cancers-11-00872-f006){ref-type="fig"}E,F).2.6. sdAb K2 restores the Tumor Cell Killing Ability of Activated PBMCs {#sec2dot6-cancers-11-00872}------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We also explored whether adding sdAb K2 to co-cultures of activated PBMCs and tumor cells would result in enhanced tumor cell killing.
PE	phycoerythrin	A sdAb specific for a multiple myeloma paraprotein, designated sdAb R3B23 \[[@B40-cancers-11-00872]\], and trastuzumab (Herceptin^®^, Roche, Bazel, Switzerland) served as negative controls.Anti-HIS mAbs (Bio-Rad, Temse, Belgium, AD1.1.10) and PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium, A85-1) were used to detect binding of HIS-tagged sdAbs to PD-L1^POS^ 293T cells.
ATCC	American Type Culture Collection	Human 293T cells and HLA-A\*0201^POS^ breast carcinoma cells (MCF7) were purchased from the ATCC and cultured according to ATCC's recommendation.
MOI	multiplicity of infection	293T, MCF7, and 624-MEL cells were transduced with PD-L1 or eGFP-encoding lentiviral vectors at a MOI of 10, while 2D3 cells were transduced with PD-1 encoding lentiviral vectors at an MOI of 5.4.6.
PBS	phosphate-buffered saline	One day prior to imaging, 938-MEL tumor-bearing mice were injected intratumorally with 50 µL (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) or IFN-γ (2 × 10^6^ IUs/mL, ImmunoTools).
MIP	maximum intensity projection	 MIP were generated using OsiriX Lite software.
SEM	standard error of the mean	Statistical Analysis {#sec4dot12-cancers-11-00872}--------------------------Results are expressed as mean ± SEM.

INLD	Indian National Lok Dal	Nobody seemed to be bothered about the question of how an organisation would fare if its president was at loggerheads with the working president.Hisar, October 18In its electoral campaign during the last Assembly poll in Haryana, the state Congress leadership, including present Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, had stated that the corrupt practices of the Chautala regime would be probed into after the party assumed power in the state.The Congress leaders had even submitted a chargesheet against the then INLD government led by Mr Om Prakash Chautala to the Haryana Governor.The chargesheet contained several serious allegations, including political patronage to criminals, rampant corruption, collection of “goonda tax” at illegal mining checkpoints, large-scale irregularities in recruitment of government employees and so on.However, nearly eight months have elapsed since the formation of the Congress government in the state, yet no action in this direction has been taken by the Hooda regime.Whatever be the reasons behind the delay, it has undoubtedly lifted the spirits of the INLD members as well as its followers and sympathisers.
NHRC	National Human Rights Commission	He challenged Mr Hooda to order a CBI or IB inquiry against his party or any of its members.Lambasting the state government for its failure to get the SYL canal issue resolved, the INLD leader said the party would soon begin a statewide stir against the Congress regime’s inability to fulfil its electoral promises.Fatehabad, October 18The NHRC has sought a report from the Superintendent of Police, Fatehabad, on the alleged discriminatory attitude of local Zila Parishad Chairman Baljit Singh Balli towards Zila Parishad vice-chairperson Mandeep Kaur Gill, a Dalit woman.The Tribune had highlighted the incident in its columns on July 15, 2005.Taking cognizance of the news report, the NHRC has sought the report.

NCCN	National Comprehensive Cancer Network	Introduction {#S0001}============As demonstrated in NCCN and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with distant metastases at initial presentation or at the time of disease recurrence is generally palliative, with no standard treatment modality having been clearly established.
ESMO	European Society for Medical Oncology	Introduction {#S0001}============As demonstrated in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and ESMO guidelines, the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with distant metastases at initial presentation or at the time of disease recurrence is generally palliative, with no standard treatment modality having been clearly established.
NPC	nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Introduction {#S0001}============As demonstrated in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, the management of NPC patients with distant metastases at initial presentation or at the time of disease recurrence is generally palliative, with no standard treatment modality having been clearly established.
5-FU	5-fluorouracil	[@CIT0001] However, the standard first-line chemotherapeutic regimen is yet to be established, although the use of gemcitabine and cisplatin (known as the GP regimen) was shown to be superior to the traditional regimen with 5-FU and cisplatin (known as the PF regimen) in a phase III randomized controlled trial.
mNPC	metastatic NPC	[@CIT0003]Another issue for mNPC is the rationality of radiotherapy for primary and regional tumors, and even for metastatic foci.
OS	overall survival	As reported in many published studies, including ours, besides systemic chemotherapy, the addition of radiotherapy to the primary tumor for newly diagnosed metastatic NPC (synchronous metastatic NPC \[smNPC\]) and palliative local treatment of the metastatic sites in selected patients would improve survival outcomes, with the 3-year OS indicated to be 33.7--60.7%.
RECIST	Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors	Thus, patients were included in the analysis between June 2013 and December 2017 if they met the following criteria: (1) metastasic foci should be histopathologically proven; otherwise, a diagnosis of distant metastases must be fully discussed and agreed by radiologists and clinicians based on evidence from at least two types of imaging modality, and no prior treatment should have been given after the metastasis diagnosis; (2) for non-bone-only metastatic disease, this should be at least one measurable disease, as assessed by RECIST; (3) for patients with smNPC, only those who received the GP regimen as systemic chemotherapy were included in the analysis, while patients with mmNPC who underwent chemotherapy with a non-GP regimen could be collected in our analysis if they had disease progression within 1 year after the GP regimen or in cases of patient refusal; (4) systemic chemotherapy should have completed six cycles; however, patients who had received four or five cycles were permitted to be included in cases of patient refusal, intolerable side effects or physician decision; and (5) there was no previous history of cancers at other sites and no history of second primary cancers.
IMRT	intensity-modulated radiation therapy	For de novo mNPC patients who underwent local radiotherapy to the primary tumor and neck lymph-node region, IMRT was applied according to our institutional protocol.
RFA	radiofrequency ablation	[@CIT0039] Local consolidative treatment to the metastatic foci was administered according to our institutional protocol: patients with oligometastasis in the lung and lymph nodes in distant parts received radiation therapy, while those with solitary metastasis in the liver were given RFA.
CDHP	chloro-2-4-dihydroxypyridine	S-1, consisting of tegafur (FT), 5- CDHP and potassium oxonate (Oxo), was orally administered twice daily after a meal for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week rest, at the following doses based on body surface area: \<1.25 m^2^, 40 mg; \<1.50 m^2^, 50 mg; and \>1.50 m^2^, 60 mg. Capecitabine was administered orally at a dose of 1--1.25 g/m^2^ twice daily in 4-week cycles, consisting of 2 weeks of treatment followed by a rest period of 2 weeks.
Oxo	oxonate	S-1, consisting of tegafur (FT), 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) and potassium Oxo, was orally administered twice daily after a meal for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week rest, at the following doses based on body surface area: \<1.25 m^2^, 40 mg; \<1.50 m^2^, 50 mg; and \>1.50 m^2^, 60 mg. Capecitabine was administered orally at a dose of 1--1.25 g/m^2^ twice daily in 4-week cycles, consisting of 2 weeks of treatment followed by a rest period of 2 weeks.
CT	computed tomography	Oral maintenance chemotherapy was scheduled for up to 24 cycles or until confirmed progressive disease, unacceptable adverse events or patient refusal.Assessments and Follow-Up {#S0002-S2004}-------------------------Response to treatment was assessed by imaging after every two courses of systemic chemotherapy and at completion of radiotherapy to the primary tumor and neck lymph-node region for all patients, as evaluated by CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to RECIST version 1.1.
MRI	magnetic resonance imaging	Oral maintenance chemotherapy was scheduled for up to 24 cycles or until confirmed progressive disease, unacceptable adverse events or patient refusal.Assessments and Follow-Up {#S0002-S2004}-------------------------Response to treatment was assessed by imaging after every two courses of systemic chemotherapy and at completion of radiotherapy to the primary tumor and neck lymph-node region for all patients, as evaluated by computed tomography (CT) or MRI according to RECIST version 1.1.
SD	stable disease	[@CIT0041],[@CIT0042] All patients achieved a response of at least SD before maintenance chemotherapy.
CTCAE 4.0	Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0	Toxicities were assessed weekly during radiotherapy and every cycle of chemotherapy, and were graded according to National Cancer Institute CTCAE 4.0.Statistical Analysis {#S0002-S2005}--------------------The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) (time from the date of diagnosis as mNPC to progression) and OS (time from the date of diagnosis as mNPC to death due to any cause).
PFS	progression-free survival	Toxicities were assessed weekly during radiotherapy and every cycle of chemotherapy, and were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE 4.0).Statistical Analysis {#S0002-S2005}--------------------The primary endpoints were PFS (time from the date of diagnosis as mNPC to progression) and OS (time from the date of diagnosis as mNPC to death due to any cause).
WHO	World Health Organization	All were non-keratinizing carcinoma according to the WHO classification, with 34 (91.9%) and three (8.1%) indicated to be undifferentiated and differentiated, respectively.
mOS	median overall survival	The 3-year OS was 87.7%, and the mOS had not been reached at the time of censoring.
DMFS	distant metastasis-free survival	A retrospective study of 44 patients with N3 disease also indicated that oral S-1 in the adjuvant setting for about 6 months after cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy could yield excellent survival outcomes compared to historical data, with the 3-year OS and DMFS reported to be 86.4% and 84.1%, respectively.
SCCHN	squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck	Although there have been no prospective trials on this issue, a retrospective study on SCCHN,[@CIT0031] which included about 10% NPC patients, lends support to our results, as it advocated that a longer period of S-1 administration as an adjuvant setting for SCCHN may be better.
EBV	Epstein-Barr virus	[@CIT0031] Prospective clinical trials incorporating molecular biomarkers, such as EBV-DNA, are warranted to illustrate this issue more clearly.Besides maintenance chemotherapy, sufficient up-front chemotherapy contributes to such excellent survival outcomes.
LRRT	locoregional radiotherapy	For smNPC, the importance of definitive LRRT has been advocated in the current NCCN guidelines and frequently emphasized in published data.
SBRT	stereotactic body radiotherapy	[@CIT0007],[@CIT0009],[@CIT0011],[@CIT0013] Local treatment strategies adopted in the current body of NPC literature include surgery, radiotherapy and RFA,[@CIT0006],[@CIT0014],[@CIT0052]--[@CIT0055] and the application of SBRT, which offers non-invasive, yet aggressive local therapy, is especially appealing in oligometastatic disease.

LCCs	low-cost carriers	Introduction {#s0005}===============The growth of LCCs around the world triggered substantial changes in airport planning, operations and in the airport business in general ([@bb0165]; [@bb0090]; [@bb0115]).
FSNC	Full-service network carriers	In other words, only a small number of LCCs, headed by Ryanair, were operating from secondary airports or airports at the lower end of the airport hierarchy.Therefore, although there is evidence that LCCs do operate in different types of airports, the idea that secondary airports are a major part of the definition of the LCC model still remains widely accepted, in the same way that large airports are seen as the home to FSNC exclusively.
BCN	Barcelona	It is clear how primary airports like BCN, Amsterdam (AMS), Dusseldorf (DUS) and Palma de Mallorca (PMI) have moved upwards and to the right, indicating a stronger participation in the low-cost segment overall.
AMS	Amsterdam	It is clear how primary airports like Barcelona (BCN), AMS, Dusseldorf (DUS) and Palma de Mallorca (PMI) have moved upwards and to the right, indicating a stronger participation in the low-cost segment overall.
DUS	Dusseldorf	It is clear how primary airports like Barcelona (BCN), Amsterdam (AMS), DUS and Palma de Mallorca (PMI) have moved upwards and to the right, indicating a stronger participation in the low-cost segment overall.
LTN	Luton	London LTN and Milan Bergamo (BGY), in contrast, are smaller secondary airports traditionally regarded as 'low-cost airports' that have manage to secure a strong position in the segment at European level.These are illustrative cases but provide a good introduction to the overall trend in all the airports in the dataset.
GVA	Geneva	EasyJet expansion in Continental Europe had a stronger expression at main airports like GVA, Nice (NCE) and Barcelona (BCN); whilst Ryanair pursued growth at smaller airports with its first continental base at Charleroi (CRL) in Belgium.

CIPDPs	Conditional Individual Partial Dependence Plots	Traveling by fixed-route bus requires one to walk to and wait at bus stops and existing walkers and bikers are used to traveling outside, but Car users, by contrast, usually spend very little out-of-vehicle travel time, which may make them more sensitive to Wait\_Time [@hitge2015comparison].Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) Plots and CIPDPs-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To further reveal individual taste heterogeneity (response heterogeneity to different trip attributes), we randomly sampled 100 instances from each subpopulation (by existing travel mode) and constructs ICE plots of the level-of-service variables for MOD Transit.
C-ICE	centered ICE	Therefore, to uncover individual heterogeneity more reliably (and more clearly), Figure \[fig:ice\_c\] uses C-ICE plots: They center the plots around a certain point within the range and display only the difference in the prediction with respect to this point [@goldstein2015peeking; @molnar].
ALE	accumulated local effects	To overcome this issue, a potential direction is to apply the ALE plot [@apley2016visualizing], by only visualizing how the model predictions change in a small “window” around a particular feature value.

IL-6	interleukin-6	Introduction {#mjy038s1}============ IL-6 is the most pleiotropic cytokine known in mammals ([@mjy038C20]).
TLRs	Toll-like receptors	IL-6 production by immune phagocytes is triggered by a wide range of stimuli, such as stress hormones, cytokines, and pathogen recognition by TLRs ([@mjy038C17]).
JAK	Janus tyrosine kinase	Following oligomerization, JAK phosphorylate the intracellular tails of gp130 which in turn recruit and activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling systems ([@mjy038C20]; [@mjy038C71]).
STAT	signal transducer and activator of transcription	Following oligomerization, Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK) phosphorylate the intracellular tails of gp130 which in turn recruit and activate STAT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling systems ([@mjy038C20]; [@mjy038C71]).
MAPK	mitogen-activated protein kinase	Following oligomerization, Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK) phosphorylate the intracellular tails of gp130 which in turn recruit and activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and MAPK signaling systems ([@mjy038C20]; [@mjy038C71]).
mTOR	mammalian target of rapamycin	In addition to the activation of STAT3 by phosphorylation of tyrosine 705, its activity is further promoted by phosphorylation at serine 727 ([@mjy038C85]; [@mjy038C21]; [@mjy038C46]) by the mTOR ([@mjy038C92]) or protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) ([@mjy038C4]).
LIF	leukemia inhibitory factor	In contrast to IL-6RA, which is specific for IL-6, gp130 is shared by all cytokines of the IL-6 family: IL-11, LIF, oncostatin M (OsM), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) ([@mjy038C20]).
OsM	oncostatin M	In contrast to IL-6RA, which is specific for IL-6, gp130 is shared by all cytokines of the IL-6 family: IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), OsM, cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) ([@mjy038C20]).
CT-1	cardiotrophin-1	In contrast to IL-6RA, which is specific for IL-6, gp130 is shared by all cytokines of the IL-6 family: IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OsM), CT-1, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) ([@mjy038C20]).
CNTF	ciliary neurotrophic factor	In contrast to IL-6RA, which is specific for IL-6, gp130 is shared by all cytokines of the IL-6 family: IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OsM), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), CNTF, and cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) ([@mjy038C20]).
CLC	cardiotrophin-like cytokine	In contrast to IL-6RA, which is specific for IL-6, gp130 is shared by all cytokines of the IL-6 family: IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OsM), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and CLC ([@mjy038C20]).
LPS	lipopolysaccharide	STAT3 activation interferes with TLR signaling, as pre-treatment of dendritic cells with IL-6 reduces maturation triggered by LPS, a bacterial TLR4 stimulus, and leads to decreased expression of the maturation markers CD86 and MHC class II ([@mjy038C57]).
pY-STAT3	phosphorylation of STAT3	LPS in turn is well known to inhibit tyrosine pY-STAT3 ([@mjy038C44]) and promote IL-6 synthesis by dendritic cells ([@mjy038C78]; [@mjy038C34]), raising the question of how this cross-talk between STAT3 and TLR4 signaling would affect cellular responses to IL-6 and LPS.In this study, we investigated how signaling of self-synthesized IL-6 affects the production of IL-6 by dendritic cells.
SOCS3	suppressor of cytokine signaling 3	However, long-term exposure to LPS releases this brake, as pY-STAT3 is inhibited by a LPS-induced increase of expression of SOCS3, a previously described suppressor of STAT3 signaling ([@mjy038C13], [@mjy038C12]; [@mjy038C35]), and this allows full IL-6 production.
RT	reverse transcription	 RT-PCR, western blot, and flow cytometry showed that IL-6RA is expressed by human CD1c^+^ myeloid and BDCA4^+^ plasmacytoid dendritic cells (mDC and pDC) isolated from the blood of healthy donors (Figure [1](#mjy038F1){ref-type="fig"}A and [Supplementary Figure S1A--E](#sup1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}).
GM-CSF	granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor	IL-6RA is also expressed by dendritic cells differentiated from human blood-isolated monocytes (moDCs) by GM-CSF and IL-4, as reported previously ([@mjy038C44]).
BMDCs	bone marrow-derived dendritic cells	Moreover, mouse BMDCs differentiated by either GM-CSF or fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) expressed IL-6RA, as reported previously ([@mjy038C31]), as well as the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7.
FLT3L	Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand	Moreover, mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) differentiated by either GM-CSF or FLT3L expressed IL-6RA, as reported previously ([@mjy038C31]), as well as the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7.
poly(I:C	polycytidylic acid	Similarly, western blot and flow cytometry experiments revealed that IL-6RA expression did not change significantly in primary mDCs after overnight stimulation with LPS or with a combination of the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic: poly(I:C) and the TLR7/8 agonist R848, nor in plasmacytoid dendritic cells stimulated with the TLR9 agonist CpG-C (Figure [1](#mjy038F1){ref-type="fig"}A; [Supplementary Figure S1A and D](#sup1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}).For the rest of the experiments, we focused on moDCs, a widely used model system for immune cell function capable of producing large amounts of IL-6 ([@mjy038C78]; [@mjy038C80]).
siIL-6RA	silencing of IL-6RA	(**F**) Western blot showing IL-6RA levels in moDCs upon siRNA siIL-6RA and non-targeting siRNA (siCntrl).
siIL-6RA	silencing of IL-6RA	To address this possibility, we performed siRNA gene siIL-6RA in moDCs and used non-targeting siRNA as a negative control (siCntrl).
siCntrl	siRNA as a negative control	To address this possibility, we performed siRNA gene silencing of IL-6RA (siIL-6RA) in moDCs and used non-targeting siCntrl.
TfR	transferrin receptor	About 35% of IL-6RA was present at the plasma membrane, similar to the TfR which also cycles via recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane (Figure [3](#mjy038F3){ref-type="fig"}A and [Supplementary Figure S4A](#sup1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}).
gMFI	geometric mean fluorescence intensity	 gMFI for individual donors are shown (isotype subtracted).
STAT3-GFP	STAT3 fused to GFP	](mjy038f04){#mjy038F4}The endosomal signaling of IL-6RA was further supported by live cell fluorescence microscopy experiments of dendritic cells expressing STAT3-GFP which is retained at the nucleus upon activation ([@mjy038C69]; [@mjy038C54]).
IL-6-GFP	IL-6 fused to GFP	In order to resolve the organelles involved in IL-6 trafficking, we increased the intracellular presence of IL-6 by overexpression of a construct coding for human IL-6-GFP.
TIRF	total internal reflection fluorescence	Live cell time-lapse TIRF microscopy experiments confirmed that IL-6-GFP and IL-6RA-mCherry co-migrated to the plasma membrane (Figure [6](#mjy038F6){ref-type="fig"}B and [Supplementary Movie S3](#sup1){ref-type="supplementary-material"}).
siCntrl	siRNA control	(**E**) Quantification of VAMP3 after siRNA gene silencing (siV3) or non-targeting siCntrl with or without 4 h LPS stimulation (mean ± SEM from 3 donors).
IgG-cntrl	IgG control	(**G**) Quantification of pY-STAT3 activation upon incubation with 1 μg/ml LPS for 4 h or 15 ng/ml IL-6 for 20 min, in the absence or presence of an IL-6-neutralizing antibody (anti-IL-6) or IgG-cntrl (mean ± SEM from three donors).
TNFα	tumor necrosis factor α	Such a release mechanism would be comparable with the signaling demonstrated for TNFα, IL-15, and IL-11 ([@mjy038C66]; [@mjy038C9]; [@mjy038C47]; [@mjy038C37]).
IL-11R	IL-11 receptor	The IL-11R is cleaved by ADAM10, making all gp130-positive cells sensitive to IL-11 induced STAT signaling, similar to soluble IL-6RA together with IL-6 ([@mjy038C74]; [@mjy038C37]).
IL-15RA	IL-15 receptor subunit alpha	IL-15 is cleaved at the plasma membrane together with IL-15RA ([@mjy038C3]; [@mjy038C18], [@mjy038C19]).

BH	black hole(s)	In this model, feedback energy associated with the growth of the central BH can lift the veil of obscuring dust and gas, and reveal, along several sightlines, an optically selected quasar.There has been a longstanding interest in understanding emission from the molecular gas in ULIRGs, as the molecular gas serves as the fuel for the starburst activity, and possibly for accreting BH(s).
SPH	smoothed particle hydrodynamics	In this contribution, we discuss the possible impact of embedded AGN on the observed molecular line emission in galaxy mergers.Numerical Methods: SPH and non-LTE Radiative Transfer=====================================================We have carried out hydrodynamic simulations with an improved version of the SPH code, GADGET-2 (Springel, 2005; Springel et al 2005).
GMCs	giant molecular clouds	Our improvements focus on including GMCs as singular isothermal spheres in a sub-grid fashion in order more accurately model emission from high excitation lines which originate in the dense cores of molecular clouds.

MD	multiple description	---abstract: 'We consider the problem of MD source coding and propose new coding strategies involving both unstructured and structured coding layers.
RD	rate-distortion	Previously, the most general achievable RD region for the $l$-descriptions problem was the Combinatorial Message Sharing with Binning (CMSB) region.
CMSB	Combinatorial Message Sharing with Binning	Previously, the most general achievable rate-distortion (RD) region for the $l$-descriptions problem was the CMSB region.
MD	multiple description	of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.\title: 'An Achievable Rate-Distortion Region for Multiple Descriptions Source Coding Based on Coset Codes'---Introduction============The MD source coding problem arises naturally in a number of applications such as transmission of video, audio and speech over packet networks and fading channels [@goyal][@videoaudio].
MD	multiple description	The MD source coding setup describes a communications setting consisting of one encoder and several decoders.
RD	rate-distortion	The problem has been studied extensively [@Ozarow][@Ahlswede][@EGC][@ZB][@VKG][@CMS], however, the optimal asymptotically achievable RD is not known even for the most elementary case when only two descriptions are considered.
PtP	point-to-point	Evidently, for the individual decoders (which receive only one description) to perform optimally the encoder must transmit the two-descriptions according to the optimal PtP source coding schemes.
ZB	Zhang-Berger	In the ZB strategy, the encoder in the first step sends a common and coarsely quantized version of the source on both descriptions, then in the next step, the encoder sends individual refinements for each decoder on the corresponding descriptions.
CMSB	Combinatorial Message Sharing with Binning	A new coding scheme called CMSB was considered in [@CMS; @CMS3] which provided a unified achievable RD region for the general $l$-descriptions problem.
SSC	Sperner Set Coding	As a result, we call the new scheme the SSC scheme.
BC	broadcast channel	Similar to the coding scheme of CMSB, the SSC scheme uses random unstructured codes.It has been observed in several other multi-terminal communications settings such as the BC [@BC], Interference Channel (IC) [@IC], variations of the MAC channel [@Nazer][@Zamir] and the Distributed Source Coding (DSC) problem [@DSC], that the application of algebraic structured codes results in improvements over random unstructured codes in the asymptotic performance limits.
IC	interference channel	Similar to the coding scheme of CMSB, the SSC scheme uses random unstructured codes.It has been observed in several other multi-terminal communications settings such as the Broadcast Channel (BC) [@BC], IC [@IC], variations of the MAC channel [@Nazer][@Zamir] and the Distributed Source Coding (DSC) problem [@DSC], that the application of algebraic structured codes results in improvements over random unstructured codes in the asymptotic performance limits.
DSC	distributed source coding	Similar to the coding scheme of CMSB, the SSC scheme uses random unstructured codes.It has been observed in several other multi-terminal communications settings such as the Broadcast Channel (BC) [@BC], Interference Channel (IC) [@IC], variations of the MAC channel [@Nazer][@Zamir] and the DSC problem [@DSC], that the application of algebraic structured codes results in improvements over random unstructured codes in the asymptotic performance limits.
RD	rate-distortion	Based on the descriptions it has received, the decoder produces a reconstruction of the source vector.An $(n,\Theta_{1},\Theta_2, \ldots, \Theta_l)$ multiple-descriptions code consist of an encoder and $|\mathcal{L}|$ decoders: $$\begin{aligned} & e_i:\mathsf{X}^n\to [1,\Theta_i], i \in\mathsf{L},\\ &f_\mathsf{N}:\prod_{i\in \mathsf{N}} [1,\Theta_i]\to \hat{\mathsf{X}}_\mathsf{N}^n, \mathsf{N}\in \mathcal{L}.\end{aligned}$$The achievable RD region is defined as follows,The RD vector $(R_i, D_\mathsf{N})_{i\in \mathsf{L}, \mathsf{N}\in \mathcal{L}}$ is said to be achievable if for all $\epsilon>0$ and sufficiently large $n$, there exists an $(n,\Theta_{1},\Theta_2, \ldots, \Theta_l)$ multiple-descriptions code such that the following constraints are satisfied:1.
EGC	El Gamal-Cover	One of the early strategies for coding over two descriptions was the EGC strategy [@EGC].
BSS	binary symmetric source	Here $X$ is a BSS, and the side decoders intend to reconstruct $X$ with Hamming distortion.
CMSB	CMS with binning	One can even interpret the main difference between these schemes to be the way the common-component between different random variables are exploited.As explained in the introduction, the best known achievable RD region for the $l-$descriptions problem is the CMSB strategy.
MDS	maximum distance separable	There are two layers of codebooks, a layer of MDS codes and a layer of Source Channel Erasure Codes (SCEC’s).
SCEC’s	Source Channel Erasure Codes	There are two layers of codebooks, a layer of Maximum-Distance Separable (MDS) codes and a layer of SCEC’s.
in $l$	involves the generation of a doubly-exponential number of codebooks	If a description is received by at least one decoder in $\mathcal{M}$, then a bin index of the codebook associated with $\mathcal{M}$ is sent on that description.Although it appears that the strategy in $l$, we show that most of these codebooks are redundant, leaving only an asymptotically exponential number of non-redundant codebooks.
SSC	Sperner Set Coding	Since the indices of the codebooks are associated with the Sperner families of sets, we call the scheme the SSC scheme.
SCEC	source-channel erasure codes	The next three can be identified as $(3,2)$ SCEC.
LCR	linear coding region	For every inequality in the LCR, there exists a unique inequality in the SSC with the same left hand side, index this inequality with the same index used in the RCR.

CEDA	Committee for Economic Development of Australia	Temporary skilled migrants have not displaced Australian workers despite fears immigrants threaten the local job market, new analysis by an independent economic organisation has revealed.Research by the CEDA has also shown immigration has not harmed the earnings of local workers.The report, "Effects of temporary migration", showed there are about two million people on temporary visas, including students, working holiday-makers, skilled workers and New Zealand citizens.The research, released on Monday, showed 70 per cent of temporary skilled migrants reside in NSW and Victoria, which have the lowest rates of unemployment in Australia.These workers are excluded from free or subsidised government services but contribute to tax revenues, "resulting in a net benefit to government budgets".

HA	hydroxyapatite	Particularly noteworthy is the work of Denissen and de Groot, in which cylinders made of HA were used as dental implants.
cement	cementum	The prisms are made of very large crystals of biological apatite, the size of which significantly exceeds that found in other mineralized tissues (their length can reach up to 100 μm, with only a few dozen nm in terms of width and thickness) and their number varies between five and 12 million prisms on one tooth crown \[[@B14-materials-12-02683],[@B16-materials-12-02683],[@B17-materials-12-02683],[@B18-materials-12-02683]\].The neck (dental cervix) and root of the tooth are covered with a thin layer of cement, resembling bone tissue in the structure and chemical composition.
FA	fluorapatite	Among the calcium phosphates that have found application in dentistry, we can mention above all HA and FA.
HFA	hydroxyfluorapatites	The mineral containing both fluoride and hydroxyl ions is called HFA.

ISO	isoproterenol	Although the benefits of exercise on any single risk factor are unquestionable, the effect of exercise on overall cardiovascular risk, when combined with other lifestyle modifications such as proper nutrition, can be dramatic.This study was carried out to evaluate the protective role of flaxseed and exercise on cardiac markers, lipids profile and inflammatory markers in ISO-induced myocardial ischemia in rats.MethodsThe research was conducted on 40 male albino rats, divided into 4 groups (n=10): group I served as control, group II has acute myocardial ischemia induced by , groups III and IV have acute myocardial ischemia induced by pretreated with flaxseed supplementation orally for 6 weeks, additionally group IV practiced muscular exercise through swimming.ConclusionRegular exercise enhances the improvement in plasma lipoprotein levels and cardiovascular protection that results from flaxseed supplementation by mitigating the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis.
DALYs	disability-adjusted life years	In 2001, there were 7.3 million deaths and 58 million DALYs lost due to CHD worldwide[1, 2].
ALA	alpha-linolenic acid	PUFA such as linoleic acid and ALA cannot be synthesized in the human body; therefore they must be obtained from the diet and thus are called essential fatty acids.
ALA	and flaxseed oils	Common sources of n-3 PUFA include fish oils (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) and some plant oils such as canola ALA.
n-3	n- 3 fatty acid [ALA; 18:3	Some varieties contain 45–60% n-3], which has been reported to increase the cellular concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in both platelets and blood vessels[8].
EPA	eicosapentaenoic acid	Some varieties contain 45–60% n- 3 fatty acid [ALA; 18:3 (n-3)], which has been reported to increase the cellular concentrations of EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in both platelets and blood vessels[8].
DHA	docosahexaenoic acid	Some varieties contain 45–60% n- 3 fatty acid [ALA; 18:3 (n-3)], which has been reported to increase the cellular concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA in both platelets and blood vessels[8].
LDLr	low-density lipoprotein receptor	Some reports recorded that flaxseed (12.5 g/day) prevented the rise in plasma triglyceride levels over a 16-week feeding period in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model but had no effect on triglycerides levels in LDLr−/− mice supplemented with 0.04 g/day of flaxseed during 24 weeks.
cTnI	cardiac troponin	Others reported that dietary flaxseed had no effect on cholesterol levels in rabbits, but even low doses (0.04– 0.2 g/day) of dietary flaxseed significantly reduce plasma cholesterol levels in the LDLr−/− mice[11, 12]. cTnI has been established as one of the most useful biomarkers for risk assessment and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome patients.
cAMP	cyclic adenine monophosphate	Alterations in the lipid profiles of isoproterenol-treated rats, attributed to enhanced lipid biosynthesis by cardiac cAMP may be responsible for the triglyceride elevation in group II[18].Table 1Levels of the cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL and HDL in plasma of control and experimental groups of ratsTriglycerides, cholesterol, HDL and LDL levels measured in plasma of the different studied rat groups.
HDL	high-density lipoprotein	The reported decrease of total cholesterol and LDL in group III and group IV could be due to the protective effects of lignan complex isolated from flaxseed in reducing the extent of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis[20].On the other hand, there was a significant increase of HDL to 34.3±1.9 mg/dl in group IV which was on flaxseed supplementation and exercise training as compared with the other groups (P <0.0001), with increase up to 129.4% increase as compared to the control (Table 1 and Figure 1).
VLDL	very low density lipoprotein	Activation of this enzyme also speeds up the conversion of the VLDL to HDL[21, 22].While the marker of ischemic myocardial injury cTnI has increased due to myocardial ischemia in group II to 0.97±0.4 ng/ml with increase up to 485% as compared to the control, flaxseed supplementation in group III ameliorated the level of cTnI to 0.2±0.02 ng/ml (P < 0.0001) almost 100% as the control.
IL-1β	interleukin-1β	Data from plasma of ten rats in each group are shown as mean ± S.D. IL-1β levels, showed a significant increase in group II (the myocardial ischemia group) up to 127.8±4.0 pg/ml with increase up to 213% relative to the control group control group (P < 0.0001) (Table 3 and Figure 4).
PTX 3	pentraxin 3	Group IV which received flaxseed supplementation and exercise training showed plasma levels of TNF-α 24.9±2.0 pg/ml with decrease down to 96.1% as compared to control group (Table 3 and Figure 4).Recent research reported that moderate endurance activity influenced circulating cytokine levels specially the TNF- α levels which could be due to production of IL-6 produced by exercising muscle as an anti-inflammatory effect[41]. PTX 3 has been proposed as candidate marker for acute and chronic heart diseases[12].
AUC	area under the curve	cTnI, PTX 3, IL-1 β and TNF- α values recorded AUC near 1 and satisfactory levels of specificity and sensitivity and hence they could be used as biochemical markers for detection of protective effects of flaxseed and muscular exercise.Table 4Receiver-operating (ROC) characteristic analysis of the predictive value of cardiac and inflammatory markersParameterArea under the curveBest cutoff valueSensitivity%Specificity%Cardiac troponin1.00.515100100Paraoxonase 10.0------Interleukin-1β1.096.5100100Pentraxin 31.00.22100100TNF-α0.8328.510070Analysis of cardiac troponin, paraoxonase 1, interleukin -1β, pentraxin 3 and TNF- α in myocardial ischemia rats and their controls (n=20).

SEM	scanning electron microscope	With a low accelerating e-beam voltage in a SEM, we image and irradiate the entire previously measured pristine nanofiber for \~2 s. Compared to the pristine nanofiber, the measured thermal conductance of the lightly irradiated (LI) nanofiber decreases in the whole temperature range considered (380--460 K) due to the reduced molecular orientation and crystallinity, and the phase transition temperature is shifted from \~450 K to \~430 K, as illustrated by the red circles in Fig.

RTT	Rett syndrome	INTRODUCTION============Complex respiratory disturbances, including atypical respiratory pauses and apneas, are a prominent feature of RTT, severely impacting health and quality of life ([@b16-0071047]; [@b34-0071047]).
nTS	nucleus of the solitary tract	Increasing evidence from mouse models suggests that respiratory dysfunction in RTT is associated with a more excited default state in the brainstem respiratory network, including in cell groups involved in respiratory pattern generation (preBӧtzinger complex) and modulation \[nucleus Koelliker-Fuse, the nucleus locus coeruleus and the nTS\] ([@b42-0071047]; [@b16-0071047]; [@b34-0071047]).
HBR	Hering-Breuer reflex	In particular, hyperexcitability within lateral subnuclei of the *Mecp2* mutant nTS, where pulmonary stretch receptors form the first synapse in the HBR pathway ([@b25-0071047]), would be expected to decrease the activation threshold for the inspiratory off-switch and thereby promote the generation of apneas in RTT.
BDNF	brain-derived neurotrophic factor	These data suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring normal sensory gating in nTS by reducing synaptic hyperexcitability might ameliorate abnormal breathing in *Mecp2* mutant mice. BDNF, which is in deficit in RTT ([@b27-0071047]; [@b15-0071047]), normally modulates excitability at primary afferent synapses in the nTS by inhibiting post-synaptic responses to glutamatergic excitation ([@b2-0071047]).
MeCP2	methyl-CpG-binding protein 2	It affects approximately 1 in 10,000 female births and is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding MeCP2, a transcriptional regulatory protein.
BDNF	brain-derived neurotrophic factor	These mice have reduced levels of BDNF, and this alteration has been linked to the etiology of RTT-related respiratory dysfunction, including abnormal excitability in brainstem networks that regulate breathing.
Wt	wild-type	Male null mice, rather than female heterozygotes, were used for these experiments because the heterozygotes are mosaic for Wt and *Mecp2* mutant cells, which cannot be distinguished in the living slice preparation.Synaptic hyperexcitability in the *Mecp2*-null lnTS---------------------------------------------------Initial recordings of evoked, spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSC, sPSC and mEPSC, respectively) from lnTS second-order neurons were performed to confirm and define in more detail the hyperexcitability phenotype previously observed in *Mecp2* nulls (Nulls) ([@b21-0071047]; [@b23-0071047]).
Nulls	nulls	Male null mice, rather than female heterozygotes, were used for these experiments because the heterozygotes are mosaic for wild-type (Wt) and *Mecp2* mutant cells, which cannot be distinguished in the living slice preparation.Synaptic hyperexcitability in the *Mecp2*-null lnTS---------------------------------------------------Initial recordings of evoked, spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSC, sPSC and mEPSC, respectively) from lnTS second-order neurons were performed to confirm and define in more detail the hyperexcitability phenotype previously observed in *Mecp2* Nulls ([@b21-0071047]; [@b23-0071047]).
Null	null	** (A,B) Raw traces and summary graphs illustrating increased eEPSC amplitude (A) and increased sPSC frequency (B) at primary afferent synapses in lnTS in *Mecp2*- Null mice compared with wild-type (Wt) controls.
Wt	wild-type	** (A,B) Raw traces and summary graphs illustrating increased eEPSC amplitude (A) and increased sPSC frequency (B) at primary afferent synapses in lnTS in *Mecp2*-null (Null) mice compared with Wt controls.
RM	repeated measures	Specifically, eEPSC amplitudes decreased on average by 11.3±2.9% after 5--10 minutes of drug exposure \[*P*\<0.01 RM-ANOVA\], by 13.6±3.0% after 10--15 minutes, and by 17.1±4.0% after 15--20 minutes (*P*\<0.001 RM-ANOVA).
Null	null	** (A) The trace illustrates a long-term recording of EPSCs evoked by 0.1 Hz TS stimulation (downward deflections) in an lnTS neuron from a *Mecp2*- Null mouse, and the reduction in eEPSC amplitude in response to LM22A-4.
Null	null	Therefore, we next sought to determine whether or not acute treatment with LM22A-4 *in vivo* would ameliorate the apnea phenotype in *Mecp2*- Null and -heterozygous (Het) mice; both genotypes exhibited qualitatively similar breathing phenotypes, which were more severe in the Nulls.

IPCC	Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change	Summary of new UN report that documents the impact of climate change on land and agriculture — and how land misuse accelerates climate change.On Thursday, August 8, the published a special 1200-page report titled Climate Change and Land, a detailed summary of current scientific knowledge of complex relationships between “climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems.”The following summary of the report’s key findings was prepared by Daisy Dunne, Josh Gabbatiss, and Robert Mcsweeney, and published by Carbon Brief under a Creative Commons license.Questions addressed in this summary:Why did the IPCC produce this report?What is land degradation?How does climate change affect land degradation?How does the land contribute to climate change?What does the report say about desertification?What are the wider impacts of climate change-driven land degradation?How can climate change affect food security?How important are socioeconomic changes for future land degradation?How could ‘negative emissions’ affect land, food and wildlife?How are the issues linked and what solutions exist?What does the report say about sustainable development, gender and the role of indigenous communities?What has the reaction been?This morning in Geneva, the IPCC published its special report on climate change and land.The land provides the “food, feed, fibre, fuel and freshwater” without which human society and its economy “could not exist”, the report says.
SPM	Summary for Policymakers	At this session, government delegates approved the 43-page “ SPM overview report line-by-line, culminating in a marathon overnight session.
SSPs	Shared Socioeconomic Pathways	This is outlined concisely in the SPM:“Pathways with higher demand for food, feed, and water, more resource intensive consumption and production, and more limited technological improvements in agriculture yields result in higher risks from water scarcity in drylands, land degradation, and food insecurity.”The “pathways” it refers to are a standard set of “ SSPs, which are used across the IPCC’s reports to give a sense of how changes in global society, demographics and economics will interact with climate change.While there are five SSPs in total, the land report mainly focuses on the first three, with each one offering significantly different outcomes.
BECCS	bioenergy with carbon capture and storage	They range from the natural-sounding – planting trees, for example – to the technologically advanced, such as using machines to suck CO2 from the air (known as direct air capture, or DAC).If pursued at scale, most of these techniques would require varying amounts of land – potentially reducing the land left for wildlife and food production.The land report emphasises that there is no one “silver bullet” when it comes to negative emissions and that, if just one technique were deployed on a vast scale, it could “increase risks for desertification, land degradation, food security and sustainable development”.Many of the modelled pathways for limiting global warming to 1.5C rely heavily on a technique called “ BECCS.
SDGs	Sustainable Development Goals	There are also significant regional differences, and the authors note that many of the responses will take time to be effective.It also considers how such “integrated response options” would affect the UN’s SDGs and the concept of nature’s contributions to people (NCP) laid out by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).In total, the report considers 40 specific responses to the issues.

CAN	Climate Action Network	Priorities include protecting and restoring natural ecosystems and moving to sustainable food production and consumption.”The report “shows that ramping up action in line with the goal to keep temperature rise to 1.5C is crucial to avoid massive disruption to our food chains”, says Wendel Trio, director of CAN Europe:“Already now many farmers in Europe lose their production and revenue due to frequent droughts, floods, heat waves and wildfires.
CCC	Committee on Climate Change	Land needs to grow our food, provide biodiversity and freshwater, give work to billions of people, and suck up billions of tonnes of carbon.”And Prof Corinne Le Quéré, Royal Society professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia and member of the UK’s CCC says the “IPCC’s findings chime with our [the CCC’s] advice to government”:“The UK needs to reduce food waste, promote healthy diets, and use land sustainably, including planting more trees and restoring degraded soils.

X, Y	xrightarrow[n\to+\infty]{a.s.}	By Remark \[equation 72\] stated at the end of Proposition \[def estimateurs\] proof, the estimator $\widehat{\lambda}_{n}$ has to verify the following equation $$X_n^2\, I^4(\widehat{\lambda}_{n}) \,(X_n^2+Y_n^2)-X_n^2\,I^2(\widehat{\lambda}_{n})\,(\widehat{\lambda}_{n}^2+1)+\widehat{\lambda}_{n}^2=0.$$ Thus $$\begin{gathered}\label{equation72bis}\left({X_n^2 -(\tfrac{2}{\pi})^2}\right) \left[{ I^4(\widehat{\lambda}_{n}) \,(X_n^2+Y_n^2) +(\tfrac{2}{\pi})^2 \,I^4(\widehat{\lambda}_{n}) -I^2(\widehat{\lambda}_{n})\,(\widehat{\lambda}_{n}^2+1) }\right]\\ + (\frac{2}{\pi})^2\, I^4(\widehat{\lambda}_{n})\, Y_n^2 - (\frac{2}{\pi})^4 \left({ (\frac{\pi}{2})^2- I^2(\widehat{\lambda}_{n}) }\right)\left({I^2(\widehat{\lambda}_{n}) - (\frac{\pi}{2})^2 \,\widehat{\lambda}_{n}^2 }\right)=0.\end{gathered}$$ We define the function $h$ for $0 < \lambda {\ensuremath{\leqslant}}1$, by $$\begin{aligned}\label{functionh}h(\lambda)= \left({\frac{\pi}{2}- I(\lambda) }\right)\left({I(\lambda) - \frac{\pi}{2} \,\lambda }\right).\end{aligned}$$ By using convergence given in (\[convergence presque sure\]), we establish that $$\left({X_n, Y_n }\right) \ \left({\tfrac{2}{\pi}\,, \,0}\right),$$ and since $0 < \widehat{\lambda}_{n} {\ensuremath{\leqslant}}1$ and $1 < I(\widehat{\lambda}_{n}) {\ensuremath{\leqslant}}\frac{\pi}{2}$, we finally showed that $$h(\widehat{\lambda}_{n}) \ 0.$$ Since $h$ is a strictly decreasing function on ${{]}{0},{1}{]}}$ and $h(1)=0$, we obtain that $$\widehat{\lambda}_{n} \ 1,$$ that is the required convergence.\Let us look now at the case where $0 <\lambda <1$ and $\theta_o = \frac{\pi}{2}$.\Convergence established in (\[convergence presque sure\]) now gives that $$\begin{aligned}\left({X_n, Y_n }\right) \ X, Y= \left({\frac{\lambda}{I(\lambda)}\,, \,0}\right).\end{aligned}$$ In the same way as before and using Remark \[equation 72\], one gets the following equality.
Y_{i}(t)	Y(t)$ is a $3$-dimensional standard Gaussian vector.\With these notations and if $Y(t)=	We can write, for any fixed $t \in \reels^2$, ${\bsX}(t)= \Delta Y(t)$, where $ Y_{i}(t)_{1 {\ensuremath{\leqslant}}i {\ensuremath{\leqslant}}3}$, one obtains: $$\begin{gathered}J_{f}^{(n)}(u, \sigma) = \frac{\sqrt{\mu}}{\sigma_{2}(T)} \frac{1}{\sigma} \int\limits_{T}\,f\left({\frac{P\Lambda \begin{pmatrix} Y_1(t)\\ Y_2(t) \end{pmatrix}} {\sqrt{\lambda_1^2Y_1^2(t) + \lambda_2^2 Y_2^2(t)}}}\right) \\ \times K\left({\frac{u-\sqrt{r_z(0)}\,Y_{3}(t)}{\sigma}}\right)\sqrt{\lambda_1^2Y_1^2(t)+\lambda_2^2Y_2^2(t)}\, \ud t.\end{gathered}$$ We define for $\sigma >0$ and $y=(y_i)_{1{\ensuremath{\leqslant}}i {\ensuremath{\leqslant}}3} \in \reels^3$, the map $g_{\sigma}$ as: $$\begin{aligned}g_{\sigma}(y)= \frac{\sqrt{\mu}}{\sigma} K\left({\frac{u-\sqrt{r_z(0)}\,y_{3}}{\sigma}}\right)\, f\left({\frac{P\Lambda \begin{pmatrix} y_1\\y_2 \end{pmatrix}}{\sqrt{\lambda_1^2y_1^2+\lambda_2^2y_2^2}}}\right) \sqrt{\lambda_1^2y_1^2+\lambda_2^2y_2^2}.\end{aligned}$$ Since the map belongs to $L^2(\reels^3, \phi_3(y)\ud y)$, the following expansion converges in this space: $$\begin{aligned}g_{\sigma}(y)= \sum_{q=0}^{\infty} \sum_{\substack{{\bk} \in \naturels^3 \\ {\left| {{\bk}} \right|}=q}} a_{f, \,\sigma}({\bk}, u)\, \widetilde{H}_{{\bk}}(y),\end{aligned}$$ while taking ${\bk}=(k_i)^t_{1 {\ensuremath{\leqslant}}i {\ensuremath{\leqslant}}3} \in \naturels^3$, $$\begin{aligned}\label{afsigma}a_{f, \,\sigma}({\bk}, u)= a_{f}(k_1, k_2)\, a_{\sigma}(k_3, u),\end{aligned}$$ where for $(k_1, k_2) \in \naturels^2$, $$\begin{gathered}a_f(k_1, k_2) = \frac{\sqrt{\mu}}{k_1!k_2!}

PDPD	Positive Displacement Powder Dispersion	The burner and fuel in combination are important to operation of a burner of the present invention, as are the burner itself, the type and quality of fuel, and integration with a PDPD.A major point in our disclosure is the surprising revelation that a solid may be heterogeneously combusted in a gas in a method that differs very little from a true single phase regime, yet differs greatly from traditional combustion practices over the years which continued to rely on two-phase principles of a stirred reactor.

FFL	Federal Firearms License	Pennsylvania State Rep. Jamie Santora (R-163) is pushing a ban on private gun sales nearly identical to the ones Michael Bloomberg-funded Moms Demand Action pushed in Washington state, Maine, and Nevada.Santora’s bill would bar the private sales that Americans have enjoyed since the Second Amendment was ratified in 1791 and would require that every sale be processed in front of an agent of the government via a background check.This means that law-abiding Pennsylvanians selling a gun to a fellow hunter, lifelong co-worker, or childhood friend would have to seek out a FFL holder and the would-be buyer would have to pass a background check just as the Orlando Pulse attacker (June 12, 2016), the Aurora movie theater attacker (July 20, 2012), Gabby Giffords’ attacker (January 8, 2011), the Fort Hood attacker (November 5, 2009), and the Virginia Tech attacker (April 16, 2007) did.According to the Delaware County News Network, Santora says his attempt to expand the frequency of background checks is “common sense.” He said, “We’re not trying to take away Second Amendment rights.

MmM	Muscle Milk and Moolians	Teams such as MmM had the synergy needed to prevent carnage from walking in for free, and MmM scout Stamjally was one of the best scouts of the time.
mix^	Mixup	x6 was also prone to running Kritzkrieg on Badlands at the drop of a hat, and perfected a brutal last push where x6 scouts would rush the point as Kalkin was ubered in up top, forcing the enemy to drop down to defend the point while Kalkin rained stickies down on top of them.These new approaches culminated in what is considered one of the greatest 6s games of all time, the Upper Bracket Finals at Season 10 LAN between Quantic Gaming (qXg) and Classic mix^.
HRG	High Rollers Gaming	Both these teams proved their mettle on Badlands during the regular season, with four convincing wins and only dropping four rounds on the map between the two.Disappointing performances by Flow at LAN eventually culminated with the creation of two new teams with diametrically opposed playstyles: a merger of mix^ and Flow combining the aggression of both teams, and a much more grinding, slow roster with b4nny known as HRG.

GCs	glucocorticoids	Therefore, a major unanswered question is the exact role played by glial cells (which constitute innate immune cells in the central nervous system, CNS) in neurodegenerative disorders.Synthetic GCs have been used therapeutically in several inflammatory disorders.
DEX	dexamethasone	To our knowledge, some studies based on corticosteroid treatments were tested in scrapie many years ago, but the main focus was on targeting PrP^sc^ or PrP^c^ \[[@B49-ijms-21-03231],[@B50-ijms-21-03231],[@B51-ijms-21-03231]\] and not the neuroinflammatory process.The specific objective of this study was to assess the effect of the synthetic GC DEX on the spread of scrapie in a natural sheep model, paying special attention to the differential expression of astroglial and microglial markers as main components of the host immune response in the brain.The overall goal consisted of determining the beneficial or detrimental role of these glial cells in the neurodegenerative progress of prion diseases.

LPS	lipopolysaccharide	Similarly, a previous study \[[@B88-ijms-21-03231]\] did not observe a decrease in microglial activation after LPS induction of neuroinflammation and intranasal DEX treatment in mice, suggesting that the dose was not sufficient to reduce IBA-1 expression.
TSE	transmissible spongiform encephalopathy	Since a natural model was used in this study, it is likely that natural TSE infections of ruminants involve mixtures of strains rather than a single strain \[[@B106-ijms-21-03231]\], but it is necessary to emphasize that it would reflect the reality much better.In conclusion, we would like to reassert the essential requirement of using natural models to provide reliable results.

ARC	Australian Research Council	People with disability take control as entrepreneurs30 June 2016People with a disability face considerable economic and social exclusion in Australia but a new research project will look at how they are taking control and creating their own jobs by becoming entrepreneurs.The study, involving researchers from UTS Business School and a number of partners in the disability services sector, has secured a $235,000 Linkage Grant from the ARC.“People with a disability have a rate of entrepreneurship 50 per cent higher than the Australian average yet we know very little about their story – the barriers they have faced, the strategies they have used to overcome these barriers, the dynamics of their business enterprises and the economic and social contribution they make,” says Professor Jock Collins, one of the chief investigators on the study.And with the rolling out of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) there is an opportunity to expand the number of people with a disability who have their own businesses.The research project aims to contribute to that in a very real way by piloting a program to help people with a disability start their own enterprises.“We hope to contribute to developing a process to assist a new generation of disability entrepreneurs,” says Professor Simon Darcy, the other chief investigator on the project and himself a power wheelchair user.“People with a disability have a rateof entrepreneurship 50 per cent higherthan the Australian average yet we knowvery little about their story.

SSI	Services International	“The outcomes of this project can feed into this new environment by empowering individuals through a design thinking process to put entrepreneurship on their agenda.”This is particularly important at a time when employment rates in the government sector – historically, the largest employer of people with disability – have declined.“In response to the desperation that people with disability have been feeling with their restricted opportunities, some have taken control of their own lives and created their own employment,” he says.Violet Roumeliotis, the Chief Executive of Settlement SSI, one of the partners in the research project, says research on entrepreneurship and self-employment of people with a disability in Australia is “well overdue”.“This research will build on the work that SSI is doing through its Ignite Small Business Start-ups initiative, which supports refugees who face similar barriers in finding employment and choose to start their own small businesses,” she says.Ross Lewis, Managing Director of Break Thru, says people with a disability often experience “the soft bigotry of low expectations”.“As the leader of an organisation that courageously promotes the value, potential and inclusion of all people in the life of their community, I appreciate the importance of this research in shining a light on the valued role of entrepreneurship,” he says.

CHB	Campbell-Hausdorff-Backer	Clearly, We are ready to state now one of our main technical ingredients, the CHB formula (see [@Wen1; @CCMN; @Siyan] for a proof in a greater generality).\[thm.finite.CHB\] Let $L_0$ and $V$ be operators such that ${\operatorname{ad}}_{L_0}^{m+1}(V) = 0$ for some $m$.

FD	finite difference	This is the most relevant method (so we saved the best for the last), since the FD method is more precise than the Monte Carlo method and, in our case, leads to a rather good approximation of the solution (but not perfect).In fact, we have computed a sequence $w_k$ of FD approximations of the solution $F_{SA}$ of Equation with $\kappa_0 = 0$ obtained by successively refining our set of nodes.
FD	finite difference	Since the domain is non-compact, in order to discretize this equation using FD, we have performed a cut-off of the domain by restricting to a rectangular domain $\Omega := [ -x_{MAX}, x_{MAX}]\times [\sigma_{min}, \sigma_{MAX}]$ with $\sigma_{min}\sigma_{MAX} =0.18^2$ and $\Omega$ significantly larger than $I \times J$.

T-t	time, as $$\label{sig-z}\sigma(z,t) = e^{\kappa	To derive the exact relationship between $z(t)$ and $\sigma(t)$, we calculate $$d(e^{\kappa t} \sigma(t)) \, =\, e^{\kappa t}(d\sigma(t) + \kappa\sigma(t) dt) \, = \, \kappa \theta e^{\kappa t} dt + \nu\sigma(t)e^{\kappa t} dW_2(t).$$ Ingrate the above from $t$ to $T$, and take the conditional expectation ${\mathbb E}_t[\cdot]$ on both sides, we obtain $$e^{\kappa T}z(t) - e^{\kappa t}\sigma(t) = \theta (e^{\kappa T}-e^{\kappa t}).$$ The above allows us to write the variable $\sigma(t)$, as a function of our new state variable $z(t)$ and T-t}z(t) - \theta(e^{\kappa T-t}-1).$$ It is easy to verify that $$\label{z-dynam}dz(t)\, = \, \nu (z(t) - \theta(1-e^{\kappa (t-T)}))dW_2(t).$$ Therefore, we arrive at the transformed model, $$\label{trans-ln-SABR}\begin{cases} \ dF(t) \, = \, \sigma(z,t)F(t) dW_1(t) & \\ \ dz(t) \, = \, \nu e^{-\kappaT-t}\sigma(z,t)dW_2(t) \, & \\ \ dW_1(t)dW_2(t) \, = \, \rho dt\, , &\\\end{cases}$$ We are now back at the previous case where the “volatility” process has no drift, although the coefficients are now time-dependent functions of the state variables.

PGW	Packet Gateway	The PGW is a network entity that anchors subscriber devices to a wireless communications network.
AN	access network	Generally, the PGW receives IP packets from a core network, and then sends those packets to the subscriber device via an AN.
PCC	Policy and Charging Control	However, before communicating the IP packets to the subscriber device, the PGW first processes the received IP packets in accordance with a well-known set of standards (i.e., 3GPP TS 23.203 V11.4.0 (2011-12) entitled “3rd Generation Partnership Project, Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects, Architecture”).As defined in TS23.203, the PGW has a set of PCC rules.
PCEF	policy control and enforcement function	These rules define a PCEF performed at the PGW.
SDF	service data flow	Particularly, the PCC rules contain packet filters that classify IP packets to SDF and a set of services to be applied for each SDF of the packet.
UDP	User Datagram Protocol	Effectively, this means that the services applied to the complete, original IP packet, as they are derived from the services applied to the individual constituent fragments, are incorrect.For example, consider a large fragmented video packet that should be marked for low latency based on a UDP port number.

GR	gamma ray	However, this is not an absolute discriminative method for lithology, and drill cuttings or cores are required for confident interpretations.Using standard log-based lithology discrimination methods, such as GR, shale volume (V~shale~), photoelectric absorption (P~ef~), and neutron (TNPH) logs, together with the aid of well reports, we identified the main lithology groups as shale (mudstone), sandstone, and limestone.
NCT	normal compaction trendline	The main differences in prediction results are related to the compaction mechanisms assumed, or the effects of hydrocarbon generation and aqua-thermal expansion, or the assumptions used in generating the correlations, and lastly the lithology of the formation.Many pore pressure methods are based on establishing a NCT versus depth.
NCT	normal compaction trendline	The advantages of this method are that it does not require a NCT and that analytical relationships are derived using meaningful calibration coefficients.
NCT	normal compaction trend	The procedure is to examine the relationship between vertical stress and vertical depth (TVD) and to estimate the ratio between log data and a NCT.
brine	by integrating the water	In our analysis we used exponents of x = 1.2 for the resistivity logs and x = 3 for the sonic velocity logs as recommended and found this worked generally well.We then estimated the hydrostatic pressure, p~h~, brine density from the surface reference point, D~KB~.$$\text{p}_{\text{h}} = \text{g} \cdot {\int_{0}^{\text{z}}{\rho_{\text{Water(D)}}\mathbb{d}z}} = \text{g} \cdot \left( {\text{D}_{\text{KB}} - \text{KB}} \right) \cdot \rho_{\text{water}} + \text{g} \cdot {\int_{\text{BSF}}^{\text{z}}{\rho_{\text{Water}}\mathbb{d}z}}$$The overburden stress is then estimated by integrating the bulk density from well log as follows:$$\ \sigma_{v} = g \cdot \left( {D_{KB} - KB} \right) \cdot \rho_{water} + g \cdot \int\limits_{BSF}^{z}\rho_{\text{log}{(D)}} \cdot \mathbb{d}z$$It is assumed that the brine density is constant, and the effect of well inclination is insignificant.Here we focus on the improved understanding of mechanical compaction in mudstone units within this basin, by assessing the applicability of Eaton\'s method, and using it to evaluate the implications for prediction of pore pressure.

MS	multiple sclerosis	For example, people with myalgic encephalopathy (ME) or MS may not noticeably be disabled, although they have to contend with many barriers – for example, services they need to access (such as clinics) are sometimes offered at times of the day when their illness is at its worst.
PTSD	post-traumatic stress disorder	Symptoms of PTSD include: Nightmares and flashbacks (daytime re-experiencing) Panic attacks Generalised anxiety and/or irritability (often severe); others notice 'personality' changes Poor self-esteem A sense of loss of future or impending doom Social anxiety or social phobia and isolationInitially most people are helped by their normal support mechanisms and talking over what happened.
BACP	British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy	You can find out more about becoming friends with a client in the BACP Ethical Framework (available online at `www.bacp.co.uk/ethical_framework`).You're Experiencing Unusual Feelings towards or from Your ClientThere will be times when you feel, and perhaps behave, uncharacteristically towards the person you are helping, as noted in Chapter 8.

PRISMA	Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis	The study protocol was registered with the PROSPERO database (registration number CRD42018046504) and we report the review according to the PRISMA guidelines ([S1 Table](#pone.0237572.s001){ref-type="supplementary-material"}) \[[@pone.0237572.ref019]\].Eligibility criteria {#sec008}--------------------We considered all types of systematic reviews which included the following characteristics:- A clearly stated set of objectives with an explicit, reproducible methodology;- A systematic search that attempts to identify all studies that would meet the eligibility criteria;- An assessment of the validity of the findings of the included studies (e.g., assessment of risk of bias and confidence in cumulative estimates); and- Systematic presentation, and synthesis, of the characteristics and findings of the included studies, +/- meta-analyses \[[@pone.0237572.ref019]\].Where some of the primary studies in the reviews were duplicated, we did not exclude the reviews, as they had different aims and objectives and thus added to the overall understanding of SCI to meet the aims of this current systematic review.
MeSH	Medical Subject Headings	Search terms included combinations of MeSH and key word terms \['Subcutaneous Infusion' OR Hypodermoclysis OR 'Subcutaneous therapy'\] and the term 'Systematic Review', with the assistance of a university librarian.
RCTs	randomised controlled trials	Only data from RCTs and prospective cohort studies were included to determine subcutaneous hydration outcomes; however, reviews exploring medications also included retrospective studies and case reports.
ALS	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	Most reviews focused on adult populations generally or specifically, for example, pregnant women and adults with ALS.

RAP	right arterial pressure	The reviews showed statistically significant improvement in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), RAP and cardiac index (CI).
CI	cardiac index	The reviews showed statistically significant improvement in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), right arterial pressure (RAP) and CI.
SCIG	subcutaneous immunoglobulin	For example, in the treprostinil study, a placebo of diluent only was used and some site reactions still reported by placebo group but analysis not provided as to whether this occurred at lower doses or only with titration \[[@pone.0237572.ref026], [@pone.0237572.ref037]\].Medications contraindicated for subcutaneous infusion administration include severe irritants such as higher supplements of potassium chloride (contraindicated as bolus but slow rates may be tolerated), lipo-soluble drugs such as diazepam which can precipitate in the skin, and medications known to cause fat necrosis such as chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine \[[@pone.0237572.ref016]\].In cases of high osmolarity medications, such as SCIG, the subcutaneous route was considered safer as the infusion had less cardiovascular risks associated with the infusion.

DGA1	diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 gene	As a proof of principle, overexpression of the endogenous acyl-CoA-dependent DGA1 by LDP1in promoter was significantly more efficient than GPD1 promoter in enhancing lipid accumulation.ConclusionIntronic sequences play an important role in regulating gene expression in R. toruloides.
ATMT	Agrobacterium tumefaceins-mediated transformation	To date, several genetic manipulation tools have been reported, such as high efficiency transformation via ATMT, high efficiency gene deletion, and constitutive and inducible promoter toolbox [7–12].
TAG	triacylglycerol	As oil producers, strong and robust promoters that function during lipid accumulation stage will be particularly useful.The production of long chain acyl-CoA, TAG and lipid bodies are the 3 major lipogenesis steps, and genes involved in these processes are the likely source of strong promoters in oleaginous yeasts.
PAT	perilipin, adipophilin and tail-interacting	Other known abundant targets are the PAT family proteins, which serve as dynamic scaffolds regulating the formation, growth and degradation of lipid bodies [15–19].Eukaryotic genes are often interrupted by spliceosomal introns, which vary greatly among different species in either density (number of introns per gene) or length [20].
IME	intron-mediated enhancement	Although introns are often perceived as junk DNA gained during genome evolution [21], some introns are known to regulate gene transcription and this effect is known as IME [22].
5′UTR	5′ untranslated region	Analysis by 5′ RACE and transcriptomics showed that the cDNA of ACC1, ACL1, FAS1, FAT1, DUR1 and LDP1 contains a 5′UTR of 150, 179, 142, 61, 303 and 194 nt in length, respectively (Table 1).
Ct	cycle threshold	Results were derived from three biological replicates and error bars indicate standard deviationTranscription of ACC1, FAS1 and LDP1 mRNAs during lipid productionGene expression of ACC1, FAS1 and LDP1 were investigated by qRT-PCR analysis, which was done by normalizing against the transcripts of actin gene (ACT1) using Ct method (2−ΔCt calculation method).
WT	wild-type strain	This quadruple disruption mutant contains only 8.5% lipids of WT (our unpublished data).
TSS	transcription start site	Through luciferase reporter assay, the application of intronic promoters derived from ACC1, FAS1 and LDP1 genes were firmly established.Promoters are generally known to be located upstream of the TSS and composed of a core promoter domain and several regulatory domains [29].
RACE	rapid amplification of cDNA ends	The concentration and purity of the extracted DNA and RNA were analyzed using NanoDrop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis.

SNP	single nucleotide polymorphism	An analysis of one SNP in the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) showed that predominant coat colour most likely was red-brown.
NCDs	non-communicable diseases	###### Strengths and limitations of this study- A major strength of this study is that it is a large-scale community-based health check intervention implemented in 32 general practice clinics and evaluated with long follow-up (1 year) and in a randomised controlled design.- The study targets both health behaviour changes and detection of NCDs and combines both patient-reported and register-based outcomes.- The patient-reported data were linked at the individual level with national health register and obtained information on NCDs, which ensured no loss to follow-up regarding this outcome.- The study focuses on individuals with low socioeconomic---an under-studied group in health check interventions.- The limitations of this study include the lack of data on smoking status in non-respondents and no access to primary care medical records with details on any condition not leading to hospital contact.Introduction {#s1}============There is a large body of evidence that developing NCDs is closely linked with modifiable health behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet and physical inactivity as well as metabolic risk factors such as hypertension, lipid levels and blood glucose, and obesity.
BMI	body mass index	[@R6] A more recent meta-analysis, including six trials conducted in general practice (n=1442--7229), showed improvements in blood pressure, total cholesterol and BMI, and reduced the proportion of patients remaining at high risk for NCDs.
SEP	socioeconomic position	[@R7] Among others, low SEP has been shown to be associated with non-participation in health checks.
GPs	general practitioners	 GPs assess patient health and implement disease-specific secondary prevention, the municipalities are tasked with primary prevention such as smoking cessation, alcohol treatment and other lifestyle-related services.
RCT	randomised controlled trial	[@R16]The 'Check-In' intervention was developed to test the effectiveness of a preventive health check in a RCT at general practice offered to individuals with low SEP as measured by short education.
COPD	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	[@R19]We set out to test if 'Check-In' results in lower prevalence of adverse health behaviour such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and obesity, and to test if 'Check-In' results in more new hospital contacts and prescription medication for metabolic risk factors and NCDs such as hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, COPD, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and depression.
ITT	intention-to-treat	For the continuous outcomes, cigarettes per day (among daily smokers), drinks per week (among those who drink alcohol) and BMI, median and IQR were estimated.The analyses were performed (i) per protocol, excluding individuals who did not attend the health check and (ii) ITT.
ICC	interclass coefficient	Information on metabolic risk factors and NCDs were obtained from registers and no missing occurred in these variables.To evaluate the stability of our results, an ICC was estimated within a two-level model with patients (level 1) nested within general practices (level 2), and all estimates were calculated in the model including the condition variable and general practices as random intercept, allowing for correlation between patients from the same general practice.
KA	kainic acid	Using two seizure models in parallel, perinatal hypoxia and early-life KA, we propose to test the following hypothesis: the inflammatory reaction provoked by early life seizures primes the developing brain so that microglia are modified, leading to rapid reactivation by a second seizure in adulthood.

CSU	Christian Social Union	REUTERS/Axel SchmidtWith Europe’s biggest economy growing robustly, Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the CSU, are able to offer voters tax relief and more investment after the Sept. 24 ballot.The allies have put aside their differences over migrants - the CSU wants a cap to which the CDU will not agree - and German media have reported that conservative lawmakers now refer to Merkel and CSU leader Horst Seehofer as the “twins”.The conservatives hold a clear opinion poll lead over the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), but would still need to team up with another party to govern.On Monday they added the goal of full employment - which they define as a jobless rate of less than 3 percent - by 2025 to their list of campaign pledges.“We think we can do this,” Merkel told a news conference with Seehofer convened to present the election program, adding that jobs were central to the quest for ‘prosperity and security for all’.Germany’s jobless rate is currently at a post-reunification low of 5.5 percent.
UPJ	ureteropelvic junction	For the last few decades open pyeloplasty has been the gold standard of surgical treatment for UPJ obstruction with a success rate exceeding 90% in the long term.\[[@CIT1]\] Inherent problems associated with large surgical incision and the need for cosmetic advantage brought in minimally invasive techniques e.g., percutaneous and endoscopic incision of the known as endopyelotomy.
UPJO	ureteropelvic junction obstruction	These procedures though associated with lower morbidity, have a success rate about 15--20% lower than that of open pyeloplasty.\[[@CIT2][@CIT3]\] Endopyelotomy is associated with poorer outcome in patients with severe hydronephrosis, poor renal function or a crossing vessel, secondary UPJ obstruction and outcomes also depend on the type of energy used for the incision.\[[@CIT4]--[@CIT6]\] To minimize the morbidity associated with open pyeloplasty and to prevail over the uncertainty of results of minimally invasive approach, Schuessler *et al* first reported dismembered laparoscopic pyeloplasty in 1993.\[[@CIT7]\] Since then its efficacy and feasibility have been duplicated in terms of the outcome of the procedure with associated advantage of minimal invasion.\[[@CIT8]\] Laparoscopic pyeloplasty is limited by a steep learning curve and the technical challenges posed by intracorporeal laparoscopic suturing.However, irrespective of the surgical procedures chosen, a high failure rate has been observed in poorly functioning units with UPJ obstruction.\[[@CIT9][@CIT10]\] Some authors have recommended nephrectomy for poorly functioning kidneys (GFR\< 15 ml /min)\[[@CIT11]\] whereas others advocate renal salvage procedures even in such poorly functioning kidneys.\[[@CIT12]\]We present retrospective nonrandomized comparison of the results of laparoscopic pyeloplasty and endopyelotomy in poorly functioning renal units, i.e., GFR less than 25 ml/min.MATERIALS AND METHODS {#sec1-1}=====================It is a retrospective analysis of records of patients from the hospital database who underwent either laparoscopic pyeloplasty or endopyelotomy for UPJO in poorly functioning units between January 1998 and June 2005.

VOS	video object segmentation	While this prior work attests to applicability of VS, generating robust visual features for VS in unstructured environments with generic objects (e.g., without fiducial markers) remains an open problem.On the other hand, VOS, the dense separation of objects in video from background, has made recent progress on real, unstructured videos.
VOS-VS	video object segmentation-based visual servo control	Finally, VOS remains a hotly studied area of video understanding, and future improvements in the accuracy and robustness of state-of-the-art segmentation methods will similarly improve our method.The primary contribution of our paper is the development and experimental evaluation of VOS-VS.
OSVOS	one-shot video object segmentation	To generate our VOS-based features, we segment objects using OSVOS [@OSVOS], which is state-of-the-art in VOS and has influenced other leading semi-supervised methods [@OSVOS-S; @OnAVOS].Visual Servo Control--------------------In addition to the visual servo literature cited in Section \[sec:intro\], this paper builds off of other methods for control design and feature selection.

mRNAs	messenger RNAs	Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment is still critical for the treatment of PTC.Besides protein-encoding mRNAs, the human genome also transcribes a large set of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) with pivotal roles in critical physiological processes and pathological changes \[[@b7-medscimonit-24-5152]\].
PTC	papillary thyroid carcinoma	Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the functionality of lncRNA-ATB in pathogenesis of PTC with an expectation of providing references for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.Material and Methods====================Subjects--------A total of 44 patients with PTC were selected in our hospital from October 2010 to October 2012.
NC	negative control	Empty pEGFPC vector was used as a NC.Transwell migration and invasion assay--------------------------------------Briefly, the upper chamber (BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA) was filled with serum-free RPMI-1640 medium containing 5×10^4^ cells, and RPMI-1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) containing 20% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used to fill the lower chamber.
Fn	Function	There's a Fn button to the front of the camera, where a DSLR's depth-of-field-preview button would often be located, while the top thumbwheel has been repositioned and angled for more comfortable use.Despite rumours that Nikon would be launching a fixed-lens compact camera with a large 1-inch sensor size, there was no such camera on display and the company refused to comment further.But that's not to say the P7700 doesn't advance its sensor: the 1/1.7-inch CMOS sensor sees the CCD of the P7100 fall by the wayside, making room for a more proficient and movie-capable compact.Other advances include wireless flash control using Nikon's Creative Lighting System, should you have external flashguns, and the rear 3-inch LCD screen is now mounted on a vari-angle bracket so it can be moved through almost any angle, far more significantly than the P7100's "pull out" angled screen.Another biggie on the list is that the P7700's 7.1x optical zoom lens, while retaining its 28-200mm equivalent zoom of its predecessor, now offers a brighter f/2.0-4.0 aperture range.
ND	neutral density	Detail geeks might like to know it's made of 13 elements (with two ED glass elements), has a seven-blade iris and also includes an in-camera ND filter.These headline features alone certainly give it more kudos than its predecessor, though it's essential when considering what else has recently hit the market - take a gander at the Canon G1 X, Sony RX100 and dabble in the rumours of the Fujifilm X-F1 and there's a lot of competitive choice.Nikon says the P7700 is also faster.
QoS	quality of service	The resulting delays caused by the repeated requirement for these preliminary negotiations negatively impact the QoS that may be delivered, even in somewhat simple transactions.
BSV	Bitcoin SV	A breakdown of this support will be a huge negative.BSV/USDThough BSV scaled above the downtrend line, the bulls could not build on the strength and push the price above the overhead resistance at $92.693.
TRX	TRX/USDTRON	Though we are positive on the XTZ/USD pair, we will wait for the bulls to assert their supremacy before proposing a trade in it. TRX has again slipped back below the 20-day EMA, which is a negative sign.
ml	millilitres	Thus, for a time, a litre, instead of being exactly 1,000 cubic centimetresor one cubic decimetre, was instead officially defined as 1.000028 cubic decimetres, because this was, asnear as could be determined, the volume that a kilogram of water actually occupied; this anomaly wascorrected in 1964, and thus now one ml is exactly the same as a cubic centimetre(often noted by the non-SI abbreviation cc instead of cm3).Thus, if it were desired to give the kilogram a reproducible physical definition based on water,it would have to be redefined so that the new kilogram was 0.999972 existing kilograms, and this wouldnot be acceptable, being too large a change, and affecting the derived units of energy and force, andhence the various electrical units.Liquid measure has always been one of the more confusing areas of measurement.In the United States, a gallon is 231 cubic inches by definition.In the British imperial system, a gallon was originally defined as the volume of ten pounds of water.Subsequently, the British gallon was defined in terms of metric units as 4.54609 litres; this was in1985, after the litre had become exactly a cubic decilitre.The Imperial gallon is larger than the U.S. gallon, but the Imperial fluid ounce is smallerthan the than the U.S. fluid ounce, due to one difference between the two systems:the space in the table dividing the part in which the U.S. units are smaller from the partin which the U.S. units are larger.
GID1	GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1	By binding to a nuclear receptor, GID1, gibberellins regulate gene expression by promoting degradation of the transcriptional regulator DELLA proteins, including GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE (GAI).

DTT	digital terrestrial television	Only with the launch of Saorview (FTA DTT) was 3e available Free to Air.Ireland commenced its switch over to its free-to-air DTT in October 2010.
DTT	digital terrestrial television	Saorview, Ireland's national free-to-air DTT service, launched officially to the public in May 2011.
DTT	digital television	They had no broadband licence and no viable business plan without selling broadband, and due to lack of funding withdrew its application in October 2002.The government also planned to privatise RTÉ's transmission network at this time but this too failed in October 2002 following the withdrawal of ITS Digital Limited DTT licence application and a number of other factors.Disability organisations and the switchoverTV Access, a coalition of organisations that promote issues surrounding individuals with disabilities and senior citizens, began a campaign to highlight the switchover from analogue to DTT broadcast services in its contribution to the Oireachtas Communications Committee heard on Wednesday, 1 April 2009.TV Access aimed to make the wider public aware of the needs of aging and disabled viewers; they also launched a website.Promotion for DTT roll-out began on 17 March 2011.Multiplex licensing processThe establishment of a commercial multiplex for Digital Television Terrestrial within Ireland was punctuated with many delays.
ASO	analogue switchover	Having provided options to stakeholders in terms of 2 options outlined in Consultation 08/44 of Mobile Telegraphy Licence or a technology neutral Wireless Telegraphy Licence, and minded by the 7 responses it received, the Mobile Telegraphy Licence was seen as the best use of spectrum, given the nature of the spectrum of 8 MHz of UHF band in between 470 and 750 MHz in the five main urban areas due to the limited spectrum arising from DTT introduction and use of 4 multiplexes as the spectrum priority prior to ASO.ComReg proposed launch of the wholesale mobile TV network following licence award be rolled out within 24 months before penalty or licence withdrawal from the winner of the contest.
OMTSPs	Other Mobile TV Service Providers	This results in third parties having access through agreements with the wholesale mobile network operator as OMTSPs in a timely, reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent manner to the network to provide their own services and electronic programme guide from up to 20 channels maximum space.The licence would be for 10 years and not automatically renewed.

FDA	federal	Clinical Trials in POMS {#sec8-children-06-00073}==========================Due to concern over the lack of RCT data addressing the unique features of POMS, there is now a demand from the FDA and European (EMA) regulatory agencies for a Pediatric Investigation plan for approval of a new biologic agent \[[@B38-children-06-00073],[@B54-children-06-00073]\] The IPMSSG addressed the challenges of completing a RCT in the POMS population with the need for controlled trials to determine the safety and efficacy of the DMT in POMS in the IPMSSG consensus statement of 2012 \[[@B38-children-06-00073]\].
NFL	neurofilament light chain	If Biomarkers range from blood to CSF tests and include neutralizing antibodies leading to less efficacy of the DMT to serum or CSF evidence of neurotrauma, as that seen with NFL, a marker of white matter axonal injury.
NFL	neurofilament light chain	A low cost, simple test, such as a blood test, to predict and/or monitor the treatment response which could enhance the long-term outcomes of the patient due to enhanced active monitoring of the MS activity would be welcome as it could minimize patient discomfort due to tests, as well as minimize their cost.There are possible biomarkers to guide therapy choice and to determine disease activity; NFL is one such biomarker.
GFAP	glial fibrillary acidic protein	NFL and GFAP concentrations in the serum and CSF have correlated with overall disease activity, reflecting a recent relapse, disease progression, or MRI activity with a new or active lesion and may reflect axonal injury \[[@B62-children-06-00073],[@B63-children-06-00073]\].

SAW	surface acoustic wave	The cost is lower, at least in part, because there is no need for a SAW filter at the output of the transmitter.A typical polar modulation transmitter 100 of the prior art is illustrated in FIG.
PA	power amplifier	The output of the voltage controlled oscillator 155 is coupled to a saturated PA 160, and the amplified signal is provided at an output 130 to an antenna.
FEM	front end module	Typically, the power supply modulator 180 and the PA 160 are provided in a FEM 190.Typically, the PA 160 needs a certain DC voltage to start providing any signal at the output 130 to the antenna.
DAC	digital-to-analog converter	These parameters can vary greatly, meaning that the PA 160 preferably provides the amplified signal over a large range of power levels, typically about three power decades.If the scaling is performed in the digital domain, the amplitude modulation controller 170 usually requires a DAC having a high dynamic range in order to provide an analog amplitude modulation signal having a good signal-to-quantization-noise ratio and suitable for allowing the power supply modulator 180 to modulate the supply voltage to the PA 160 sufficiently for the PA 160 to output the amplified signal over the desired large range of power levels.

JBIC	Japan Bank for International Cooperation	The company aiming to build a high-speed railway between Dallas and Houston in Texas – America’s first high-speed railway, if built – has secured a $300m loan from Japanese state lenders, sparking ire from a French group that wanted to build the line.Texas Central Partners will use the cash to progress permitting, design and engineering, according to The Dallas Morning News, reported the AP news agency.The loan gives the company sufficient equity to move forward with construction once the scheme, provisionally costed at up to $15bn, receives official approval, said reports.Japan is willing to lend the money because the company plans to use Japanese Tokaido Shinkansen bullet trains and technology for the 386-km line.Lenders are the JBIC, wholly owned by the Japanese government, and Japan Overseas Infrastructure Investment Corporation for Transport & Urban Development, or JOIN, which is 87% owned by the government.“By strengthening support for exporting Japan’s Shinkansen system to the United States, this financing is expected to contribute to maintaining and increasing the international competitiveness of Japanese companies,” JBIC said in a statement.“This is a loan to be paid back with interest,” said Texas Central Partners in a statement.

ROS	reactive oxygen species	INTRODUCTION {#sec1-1}============Liver is the most important organ responsible for xenobiotic metabolisms, acting as sensitive target site for substance modulating biotransformation.\[[@ref1]\] During aerobic metabolic reactions, considerable amounts of ROS such as superoxide anion (O^2−^) and hydrogen peroxide (H~2~O~2~) are produced,\[[@ref2]\] which enter a variety of chain reactions and generate free radicals such as ^•^OH.
CAT	catalase	These hydrogen species assault polyunsaturated fatty acids and thereby initiate the process of lipid peroxidation causing degradation and inactivation of various important biomolecules.\[[@ref3]\] This situation resulting in many complications such as; oxidative stress, antioxidant alteration, decreasing of the intracellular level of glutathione (GSH), reduction of CAT activity which leading to tissue injury and carcinogenesis.\[[@ref4][@ref5]\]Many xenobiotics (drugs and environmental chemicals) are capable of causing some degree of liver injury.\[[@ref6]\] As lifestyle changes, hepatic injuries have become one of the most common diseases in the world attributed to great morbidity and mortality especially in developing countries.\[[@ref7]\] Therefore, many efforts have been made recently for discovering new products of natural origin, which can limit the xenobiotic-induced hepatic injury.Carbon tetrachloride (CCl~4~) is widely used to study hepatotoxicity in animal models by starting lipid peroxidation.\[[@ref8]\] CCl~4~ is biotransformed in the liver forming reactive metabolic trichloromethyl radicals (^ˉ^ CCl~3~) which reacts with excess O~2~ producing reactive free radicals.

MuRF1	muscle RING-finger protein-1	Increased Smad2/3/4 signaling inhibits Akt/mTORC1 signaling and activates the expression of ubiquitin proteasome E3 ligases, atrogin-1 and MuRF1, ultimately leading to a decrease in protein synthesis and increased protein degradation.
HDAC4	histone deacetylase 4	Increased Smad1/5/8/4 signaling activates Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and represses the HDAC4/myogenin-mediated activation of E3 ligases (including MUSA1) under atrophic conditions, such as denervation.
PLD1	phospholipase D1	The enzyme PLD1 synthesizes PA, and PLD1 overexpression activates mTORC1 signaling and represses the expression of the E3 ligases, atrogin-1 and MuRF1.
GDF	growth differentiation factor	For example, Smad2/3 signaling is activated by members of the TGF-β and activin subfamilies and by some members of the GDF subfamily, whereas Smads 1/5/8 are activated by members of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and GDF subfamilies \[[@bib-028],[@bib-029]\] ([Figure 1](#fig-001){ref-type="fig"}).
BMP	bone morphogenic protein	For example, Smad2/3 signaling is activated by members of the TGF-β and activin subfamilies and by some members of the growth differentiation factor (GDF) subfamily, whereas Smads 1/5/8 are activated by members of the BMP and GDF subfamilies \[[@bib-028],[@bib-029]\] ([Figure 1](#fig-001){ref-type="fig"}).

siRNA	short interfering RNA	To date, the number of studies that have examined the role of PA-synthesizing enzymes in skeletal muscle is quite limited (for reviews, see \[[@bib-025],[@bib-026]\]); however, two recent studies have significantly expanded our understanding of the role of the PA-synthesizing enzymes, PLD1 and the zeta isoform of DGK (DGKζ), in the regulation of mTORC1 signaling and skeletal muscle mass \[[@bib-073],[@bib-074]\] ([Figure 1](#fig-001){ref-type="fig"}).The synthesis of phosphatidic acid by phospholipase D1 as a regulator of skeletal muscle mass {#s03_1}---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In the first of these studies, the pharmacological inhibition, and siRNA-mediated knockdown, of PLD1 was shown to induce atrophy in cultured myotubes, suggesting that PA produced by PLD1 is necessary for maintaining muscle mass \[[@bib-073]\].
mTORC2	mTOR complex 2	The PLD1/PA-induced inhibition of these atrophy genes appears to be due to the activation of Akt, possibly via the activation of the rapamycin-insensitive mTORC2 \[[@bib-076]-[@bib-078]\].

RanGEF	Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor	This is determined by the Ran GTPase activating protein (RanGAP) in the cytoplasm and the RanGEF in the nucleus \[[@B17-viruses-09-00014]\].
TBEV	tick-borne encephalitis virus	It has also been shown in WNV and TBEV that C is permissive to major deletions, with large segments able to be deleted without greatly affecting the ability to encapsulate the viral genome, although they are less infective \[[@B23-viruses-09-00014],[@B24-viruses-09-00014],[@B25-viruses-09-00014]\].
NS	nonstructural	 NS Protein 5 (NS5) {#sec3dot2-viruses-09-00014}----------------------------------------Of the NS proteins, NS5 has garnered much interest regarding its nuclear localisation over the past few years.
RdRp	RNA-dependent RNA polymerase	NS5 is a large (\~103 kd), highly conserved enzymatic protein with both RdRp and methyltransferase abilities, and has been shown to be intimately involved with viral RNA replication within the RCs.
ii	introducing these mutations; or	Why this is occuring is not fully understood, but may be due to DENV NS5's ability to modulate IL-8 \[[@B43-viruses-09-00014],[@B44-viruses-09-00014]\], but could also be due to (i) potential structural conformational changes in NS5 that occur from ii altering NS5 binding affinity with viral or host proteins during replication \[[@B45-viruses-09-00014]\].
LMB	leptomycin B	Through the use of the CRM1-inhibitor LMB, it has also been observed that DENV NS5 can accumulate within the nucleus.
ssRNA	single-stranded RNA	These observations have not been so well defined and are somewhat difficult to interpret, especially the possibility of viral RNA synthesis in the nucleus, as both more sophisticated and specific labelling methods have not consistently detected either viral ssRNA or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) within the nucleus \[[@B55-viruses-09-00014],[@B56-viruses-09-00014]\].
dsRNA	double-stranded RNA	These observations have not been so well defined and are somewhat difficult to interpret, especially the possibility of viral RNA synthesis in the nucleus, as both more sophisticated and specific labelling methods have not consistently detected either viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or dsRNA within the nucleus \[[@B55-viruses-09-00014],[@B56-viruses-09-00014]\].
IFN	interferon	Type I IFN is produced in response to viral infections, and plays an important role in innate immunity towards viral infection, with the ability to activate sevaral antiviral pathways \[[@B62-viruses-09-00014],[@B63-viruses-09-00014],[@B64-viruses-09-00014]\].
JAK-STAT	Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription	It is a common theme for flavivirus NS5 to inhibit the IFN mediated JAK-STAT signalling \[[@B65-viruses-09-00014],[@B66-viruses-09-00014],[@B67-viruses-09-00014],[@B68-viruses-09-00014]\], aiding in virus replication.
PTB	polypyrimidine tract binding	During DENV infections, a clear distribution of PTB protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has been suggested to play a positive role in viral replication, with siRNA knockdown of PTB inhibiting replication, and overexpression stimulating replication \[[@B78-viruses-09-00014]\].
SG	stress granules	The additional advantage of WNV sequestration is that TIAR/TIA1 are also associated with the formation of SG and, by inhibiting SG formation, may prevent priming of the innate immune response \[[@B80-viruses-09-00014],[@B81-viruses-09-00014]\].Although it is yet to be elucidated exactly which viral proteins mediate the sequestration of nuclear proteins within the cytoplasm, it is clear that many flaviviruses have evolved to specifically restrict the intra-nuclear shuttling of many host proteins that aid in the replication of the viral genome but equally restrict host cell immune sensing and communication.

BSI	bloodstream infection	Accordingly, the newest task force guidelines on sepsis ask clinicians to place urgent attention on rapid recognition and diagnosis of sepsis, but diagnostic tools for sepsis are imperfect.^[@R4]^Clinicians regard blood cultures as a key test when considering the diagnosis of sepsis or BSI.
JHCC	Johns Hopkins Children's Center	Blood cultures, however, have a yield of only 5--15%, and up to half are falsely positive.^[@R5]--[@R7]^ These false-positive blood cultures represent diagnostic errors, lead to unnecessary antibiotics and additional testing, and are associated with increased lengths of stay and hospital costs.^[@R8],[@R9]^ Importantly, increased antibiotic use may lead to antibiotic resistance.^[@R10]^ In addition, cultures from central venous catheters are more likely to be contaminated than those drawn from peripheral venipuncture, and failing to obtain cultures from peripheral venipuncture may both miss true BSI and overestimate the incidence of catheter-related BSI.^[@R11]--[@R13]^ Blood cultures, therefore, signify a prime opportunity to engage in diagnostic stewardship, an increasingly important construct in which refined used of diagnostic tools can decrease the utilization of tests, minimize false-positive results, and ultimately improve treatment decisions.^[@R14]^Prior work at the JHCC has successfully and safely reduced blood culture use in critically ill children using clinical decision support tools.^[@R15]^ These tools consisted of a Fever/Sepsis Screening Checklist and a Blood Culture Decision Algorithm that clinicians would review and complete when considering ordering a blood culture.
PICUs	pediatric intensive care units	The JHCC project demonstrated a nearly 50% reduction in blood culture rate without increase in incidence of mortality, suspected sepsis, or suspected septic shock; and no increase in episodes of sepsis/septic shock in which patients received antibiotics in the absence of blood cultures.^[@R15]^ Based on this success, we subsequently implemented a multicenter quality improvement program to reduce unnecessary blood culture use in additional PICUs.The objective of this project was to develop a customizable framework for implementation of a clinical approach to blood cultures intended to reduce unnecessary testing and to evaluate if this framework could successfully reduce blood culture use in critically ill children across diverse clinical settings and various institutions.METHODS=======Setting-------Johns Hopkins University was the coordinating center, facilitating quality improvement initiatives at 3 ICUs in 2 study sites.
CVCs	central venous catheters	During the visits, participants reviewed project outcomes, challenges, and successes; shared particularly useful or high-impact strategies and discussed new or unanticipated barriers encountered during the implementation process.Outcome Measures----------------The primary quantitative outcomes were the number of blood cultures drawn per 100 patient days in each of the 3 units and the number of cultures drawn from CVCs versus peripheral venipuncture.
CI	confidence interval	Comparing postimplementation to preimplementation periods among all 3 units, the blood culture rate decreased by 32% \[95% CI, 25--43%; *P* \< 0.001\].###### Total and Central Venous Catheter Blood Culture Rates per 100 Patient Days before versus after a Quality Improvement Initiative to Optimize Blood Culture Use in Units A, B, and C![](pqs-3-e112-g002)!

RMSEA	root mean square error of approximation	The proximal-distal model with slight modification was supported by fit statistics [χ(2)=16.04, df=13, P=.25, RMSEA=0.024], indicating that the impact of clinical factors on QoL is mediated through a range of functional and psychological factors, except for hemoglobin which impacts directly on QoL.
LED	light emitting diode	Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to LED illumination control using a simple digital command structure.2.
IC	integrated circuit	FieldVarious features generally relate to random number generators, and more specifically to random number generators that utilize the settling time of one or more bit cells as an entropy source.BackgroundAs mobile electronic devices, such as portable telephone devices, laptops, tablets, IC cards, etc., are rapidly becoming more common, there is an increasing demand for high-level, robust cryptographic security systems that protect data in small-sized electronic circuits.
SRAM	static random access memory	For this reason, cryptographic systems that utilize true random numbers to generate secret keys are more secure than those that utilize pseudo-random numbers.One source of entropy for true random number generation is the initial state (i.e., power up state) of SRAM cells, which in theory could be either a logical 1 or 0 with equal probability.
5NT	5'-nucleotidase	The experimental data showed depressed purine efflux at similar cytosolic AMP concentrations during the second of two identical periods of underperfusion and analysis with a mathematical model indicated downregulation of 5NT late in the first period of underperfusion.
AK	adenosine kinase	Evidence has also been accumulating in the literature that the rate of adenosine formation in the cytosol is not solely dependent on 5NT activity, but is the result of at least four factors: the AMP concentration, and the activities of three enzymes which influence this concentration: AK, which rephosphorylates adenosine to AMP, AMP deaminase, which deaminates AMP to IMP, and finally AMP-preferring 5'nucleotidase, which dephosphorylates AMP to adenosine.
HHP	His-His-Pro	A protein with a well-defined solution structure (Escherichia coli thioredoxin) was used as the model system, and the peptide HHP fused to the N-terminus of the protein was used as the metal binding tag.

IRR	ideal relaying receiver	In addition, the authors in [@L4] and [@khaled2] focused on AF relaying systems with EH constraints for an IRR protocol.To the best of our knowledge, the performance of wireless EH two-hop AF relaying networks over $\alpha$-$\mu$ fading channels has not been evaluated before in the literature.
i.n.i.d.	identically distributed	Therefore, we derive new expressions for the EC in independent and not necessarily i.n.i.d.
PDF	probability density function	It is also assumed that the fading coefficients remain constant during a transmission block time $T$ but vary independently from one block to another.Since we assumed that the channel envelope $r$ follows the $\alpha$-$\mu$ distribution, the PDF of the $i-$th hop is given by [@galym] $$\label{pdf_h_i}f_{h_i}(r) = \frac{\alpha_i \mu_i^{\mu_i} r^{\alpha_i \mu_i - 1}}{\hat{r}^{\alpha_i\mu_i} \Gamma(\mu_i)} \exp\left( -\frac{\mu_i}{\hat{r}^{\alpha_i}} r^{\alpha_i} \right),$$ where $\alpha_i > 0$ is an arbitrary parameter, $\hat{r}$ indicates the $\alpha-$root mean value given by $\hat{r} = \sqrt[\alpha]{\mathbb{E}\left[r^{\alpha_i}\right]}$, $\mathbb{E}\left[\cdot\right]$ stands for the expectation operator and $\Gamma\left(\cdot\right)$ denotes the Gamma function defined as $\Gamma(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} t^{s-1} e^{-t} dt $ [@gradstein].
SNR	signal-to-noise ratio	Also, $\mu_i\ge \frac{1}{2}$ is the inverse of normalized variance of $r^{\alpha_i}$ given by $$\mu_i = \mathbb{E}\left[r^{\alpha_i}\right] / \left( \mathbb{E}\left[ r^{2\alpha_i} \right] - \mathbb{E}^2\left[r^{\alpha_i}\right] \right).$$ Note that the $\alpha$-$\mu$ distribution is the most appropriate fading distribution that can be used to describe small-scale fading channels, e.g., Rayleigh ($\alpha=2$, $\mu=1$), Nakagami$-m$ ($\mu$ is the fading parameter with $\alpha=2$), Weibull ($\alpha$ is the fading parameter with $\mu=1$) [@magableh].Ergodic Capacity----------------We define the EC as $$\label{erg_capacity}\mathbb{E}\left[C_D\right] = \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}\left[\log_2\left(1+\gamma_D\right)\right],$$ where $C_D$ and $\gamma_D$ indicate the capacity and SNR at the destination, respectively; the factor $\frac{1}{2}$ shows that the $S$-to-$D$ transmission requires two time slots.Time-Switching Relaying=======================The principle of the TSR protocol is as follows.

DCNF	Daily Caller News Foundation	Kevin Daley at The DCNFThe Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday over the Trump administration’s bid to append a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire.Democratic states and city governments are challenging the citizenship question, fearing that diminished noncitizen participation will deprive them of federal funding and seats in Congress.
APA	Administrative Procedure Act	Furman said that Ross violated the APA, a federal statute that governs agency decision-making.“[Ross] failed to consider several important aspects of the problem; alternately ignored, cherry-picked, or badly misconstrued the evidence in the record before him; acted irrationally both in light of that evidence and his own stated decisional criteria; and failed to justify significant departures from past policies and practices — a veritable smorgasbord of classic, clear-cut APA violations,” his decision reads.Elsewhere in the decision, Furman said Ross’s explanations for adding the citizenship question were pretextual, meaning his official explanations appear to differ from his actual motivations.Two other district judges went further, saying that the citizenship question violates the Constitution, which requires an “actual enumeration” of persons.New York Attorney General Letitia James is leading a coalition of city and state governments challenging the citizenship question before the high court.
ACLU	American Civil Liberties Union	“All the evidence in the record demonstrates that a citizenship question would cause millions of noncitizens and Hispanics to not respond to the census, undermining the accuracy of the constitutionally required headcount.”The states elsewhere say the Commerce Department could collect the citizenship data it seeks through existing federal records from the Social Security Administration the Citizenship and Immigration Services, belying the need for a census question on this subject.The ACLU and congressional Democrats will also argue against the citizenship question before the justices on Tuesday.Looking to the future, Loyola Law School Professor Justin Levitt suggested in a forthcoming paper that granular citizenship data could serve as a basis for redistricting and apportionment in the future, instead of total population.

MSCs	mesenchymal stem cells	Therefore, a major goal in the development of successful anti-fibrotic therapies is either restoration of a reparative phenotype in injured tissue or a reduction in fibrosis progression.Placental tissue is known to be a rich source of growth factors and cytokines, hyaluronic acid-rich matrix, and endogenous viable cells, including MSCs \[[@B2-ijms-21-04242],[@B3-ijms-21-04242]\].
TGF-β	transforming growth factor-β	Hyaluronic acid, a major ECM component of placental and umbilical tissue, has been shown to suppress TGF-β, a collagen-inducing pro-fibrogenic cytokine, and inhibit differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts \[[@B9-ijms-21-04242]\].
FPF	flowable placental formulation	Bleomycin-induced fibrosis studies carried out in aged mice would serve to confirm age as a crucial factor in the occurrence of fibrosis \[[@B11-ijms-21-04242]\].We hypothesized that a FPF could attenuate inflammation and fibrosis in the in *vivo* model of dermal fibrosis.

PEMs	plastic encapsulated microcircuits	Further, in recent years, hermetically sealed components have become difficult to find, and a move has been made to commercial grade PEMs.However, there are long-term reliability problems associated with commercial PEM devices.
COTS	commercial off-the-shelf	On the other hand, subjecting parts through “test-to-failure” programs can be very costly and time consuming.Further, COTS/PEM devices are not in full compliance with certain requirements and not recommended for use for high reliability applications in severe environments.Alternatively, to provide the appropriate hermeticity and power requirements for a reasonable cost, low-cost printed circuit boards have been widely used as substrates for direct mounting of semiconductors in commercial electronic products.
COB	chip-on-board	This approach is often referred to as COB or MCM-L (multi-chip module-laminate) packaging technique.

SOC	soil organic carbon	Studies of agricultural systems in the United States suggest that land-use changes caused severe SOC loss from 1850 to 1960; but since the 1960s, improved farming practices (e.g., no-till) and increased C return to the soil have caused SOC to stabilize or possibly increase in some areas \[[@CR15], [@CR16]\].
LCT	Land Cover Trends	Quantifying the magnitude and spatial variation of regional carbon sources or sinks was found to be difficult because of the high spatial variability in site conditions and the diversity of human management.More recently, high-resolution land-change datasets, such as the US Geological Survey's LCT dataset have become available \[[@CR34], [@CR35]\].
IBIS	Integrated Biosphere Simulator	The sequential LUCC maps for the Piedmont ecoregion have a 60-m spatial resolution, a much finer resolution than any previously used in C accounting for the conterminous United States \[[@CR19], [@CR20], [@CR37]\].In this study, we report the use of the IBIS in simulating carbon dynamics of forest and agricultural ecosystems in the Piedmont ecoregion from 1971 to 2010.

NPP	net primary productivity	The input C flux of the ecosystem is the NPP, which is calculated from climate, soil and vegetation conditions.
MPI	Message Passing Interface	Therefore, IBIS has been recently enhanced in several aspects, including: (1) program recoded to support parallel computing using MPI on super-computers; (2) treatment of fractional vegetation cover within a single land pixel in order to use the newly available higher resolution LUCC products; (3) spatial scalars for tree biomass growth and crop grain production at county level to deal with diverse geography.
NPP	net primary productivity	Forest thinning removes an amount of tree carbon which is not usually a detectable change in forest cover fraction.For this study, the following LUCC were considered: logging, deforestation (forest to agriculture conversion), afforestation (agriculture to forest conversion), agriculture contraction (agriculture to grassland conversion), agriculture expansion (grassland to agriculture conversion), and urbanization (forest to urban, grassland to urban, and agriculture to urban).Carbon output variables of the IBIS model include live and dead biomass, soil organic carbon, carbon losses from disturbance, as well as NPP and net biome productivity (NBP).
NBP	net biome production	Forest thinning removes an amount of tree carbon which is not usually a detectable change in forest cover fraction.For this study, the following LUCC were considered: logging, deforestation (forest to agriculture conversion), afforestation (agriculture to forest conversion), agriculture contraction (agriculture to grassland conversion), agriculture expansion (grassland to agriculture conversion), and urbanization (forest to urban, grassland to urban, and agriculture to urban).Carbon output variables of the IBIS model include live and dead biomass, soil organic carbon, carbon losses from disturbance, as well as net primary productivity (NPP) and NBP.
PFT	plant functional type	Similarly, agricultural land summaries may also contain a small amount of forest and other vegetation covers.IBIS uses biome level PFT to represent major vegetation groups, which are coarsely defined in the model based on climate conditions.
COLE	Carbon On Line Estimator	Forest growth curves from the COLE \[[@CR55], [@CR56]\] were used as the general forest growth references to be compared with IBIS growth curves.Data sources {#Sec5}------------Land-change information from the LCT project, wildland fire scar and burn severity data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project \[[@CR57]\], and vegetation canopy percentage and vegetation height information from the Landfire project \[[@CR58]\] were the key variables for calculating vegetation fraction and biomass on each land pixel, as well as the effects of logging, deforestation, afforestation, urbanization, agricultural expansion and contraction, and wildland fire on C changes.
NASS	National Agricultural Statistics Service	For agricultural ecosystems, county-level grain yield statistics were downloaded from the USDA NASS website (<https://www.quickstats.nass.usda.gov/>) and used to calibrate simulated cropland grain yield.Results {#Sec6}=======Land cover change trends and annual maps {#Sec7}----------------------------------------Statistics showed net decreases in forest (−4.76 %) and agricultural (−1.27 %) land area and net increases in urban (4.49 %) and disturbance areas (1.14 %) between 1973 and 2000.

MMMFs	money market mutual funds	The money premium makes short-term wholesale funding even more attractive (Greenwood, Hanson, and Stein 2015).Two important mechanisms of private money creation outside banking are repurchase agreement or repo markets and MMMFs.
SEC	Securities and Exchange Commission	From 1983, the SEC set credit standards for MMMFs’ asset pools and permitted them to use a fixed $1 par value for share transactions.
ON RRPs	overnight reverse repurchase agreements	 ON RRPs were introduced as a floor on the funds rate once the bottom of the target range was raised above zero.
SLR	supplementary leverage ratio	The size-based capital ratios also have a more stringent version for certain very large U.S. bank holding companies, insured bank subsidiaries of which are subject to an enhanced SLR of 6 percent.Leverage ratios endeavor to address two drawbacks of risk-weighted ratios.
LCR	Liquidity Coverage Ratio	The LCR can be thought of as a 30-day liquidity stress test, requiring banks to keep enough liquid assets to meet a specific scenario of a run on their short-term funding.
NSFR	Net Stable Funding Ratio	The NSFR limits maturity mismatch on banks’ balance sheets.
NAV	net asset value	Because of the difficulty of discriminating between positions held in anticipation of price changes and those held to facilitate market-making, hedging, and other permitted activities, the Volcker Rule is accompanied by extensive record keeping requirements, and its implementation will depend on regulators’ interpretation even more than for other post-crisis rules.Changes in the rules affecting MMMFs include permitting a fixed NAV only for funds that invest in U.S. government-issued securities and repo, or serve exclusively retail investors.
GCF	General Collateral Financing	Dealers themselves want to have matched books, that is, facilitate trades for customers, but limit their own net risk, and inter-dealer trading that achieves this has been moving to a facility called the GCF Repo Service.

FOIA	Freedom of Information Act	The Washington, DC, government prides itself on its transparency, but digging up the facts about it’s red light camera and other ticketing policies is difficult, with officials referring reporters to outdated information and some data only coming through FOIA requests.It is also necessary to slice and dice the facts because the revenue the District receives is not the same as the money violators owe but have not paid.For example, Breitbart News asked the D.C. Office of Tax Revenue about the money generated through tickets, and the office responded that in Fiscal Year 2017, “photo ticket revenue” was slightly over $100 million and about $98 million in Fiscal Year 2018.Non-photo tickets (parking, speeding, and other infractions) totaled $62 million in 2017 and almost $64 million in 2018, according to the office.But that does not accurately reflect just how much money the District generates from its ticketing programs, including from the 145 red light cameras set up across the area and uncollected tickets.AAA Mid-Atlantic keeps close tabs on the District and its ticketing policies, releasing its latest findings in February of this year:Call it the “Rumpelstiltskin effect.” The District processed 2,719,600 parking and traffic tickets during Fiscal Year 2018.
DMV	Department of Motor Vehicles	The District DMV is responsible for processing and adjudicating parking and traffic tickets.
DDOT	District of Columbia Department of Transportation	“In some cases, certain fines doubled.”“With the increased fines, the District is burying some motorists under an avalanche of debt and imposing an ‘undue burden on those who cannot afford to pay,’” Townsend said in the report.Breitbart News also asked D.C. Metropolitan Police Department and the DDOT the same question: “Do you have data to show how much money is generated at what intersections, roads, or stop signs?”Breitbart News received two different answers.From DDOT: “DMV does not collect the data by camera or intersection.”From the police: “The DC DMV captures this data.”But Washington Business Journal got much more information from its FOIA request:The southbound lane of Kenilworth Avenue in D.C. serves mostly as a busy feeder onto Interstate 295 or Benning Road NE.
DMV	Department of Motor Vehicles	The District is garnishing District tax refunds and “siccing” collection agencies on deadbeat ticketholders.“Debt collectors brought in approximately $127 million in outstanding debts, fines, and fees, such as overdue parking and traffic ticket fines and ticket debt, owed to the District DMV from FY 2014 through FY 2017,” AAA Mid-Atlantic reported on information from D.C.’s chief financial officer.Money collected through parking and photo citation enforcement is kept in the District’s General Fund, which is used to fund government operations, debt financing, and to subsidize water and sewer services.In 2018, the General Fund sat at about $9.1 billion, according to Washington City Paper.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

IoT	Internet of Things	What is Waltonchain?Founded in November 2016, WaltonChain is a Chinese-Korean project that aims to solve the issue of centralization in the (“IoT”).
OPC	Open Platform Communications	Under the current centralization schema, a company that engages various IoT platforms/devices to collect data about its machines, products and processes has highly isolated data, which is of little use externally.Centralized solutions, such as the (“OPC”) standard, have been developed to address this problem.
RFID	radio frequency identification	A decentralized solution would unlock the benefits of IoT to the masses.How does Waltonchain fit into all of this?Walton’s solution is to create a business ecosystem that marries the capabilities of (“RFID”) and blockchain technology.
VIoT	Value Internet of Things	Unlike the majority of blockchain projects that exist today, Walton is one of the few attempting to combine proprietary hardware and software solutions to address this problem to create an ecosystem that they are calling the (“VIoT”).
EPC	Electronic Product Code	These benefits include:Higher sensitivity higher transmission power better anti-interference capabilities lower reading error better compatibility: the chip can achieve high-frequency and ultra-high frequency functions at the same time, so the end customer can read the information through their smart phone and inquire about reliable product information the ability to be recognized en masse, versus current solutions that must be scanned in smaller groups/individually the ability to write directly onto Walton’s blockchain Additionally the chips are designed with an eye towards security: the chips will be written into the world’s only (“EPC”), a unique number that identifies a specific item in the supply chain, as well as integrate a real random number generator, which will generate a unique address through encryption logic (Source).
source	simultaneously and can write directly onto the blockchain as well	This is a win-win for both customers and Waltonchain — this has the effect of adding security to the overall network by incentivizing more scanners to be used (thereby increasing the amount of nodes online), while also significantly decreasing costs to customers who buy into all the features of the ecosystem.Functionally, Waltonchain’s scanners have the ability to read up to 1,500 products source.
PoST	Proof of Stake & Trust	This gives Waltonchain the capability to handle a larger aggregate number of transactions, making it significantly more scalable than existing blockchain projects, like Ethereum (in its current state).The Walton parent chain itself will utilize a dual-chain consensus structure, a combination of (“PoST”), which is an upgrade over Proof of Stake (“PoS”), and Proof Work (“PoW”).

CEGIS	Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services	Photo: Firoz AhmedThe Padma, the Ganges and the Jamuna have taken away around 1.5 lakh hectares of land but returned only 53,000 hectares in the last four decades.In other words, the country has lost to the three rivers around one lakh hectares or 1,000 square kilometres of arable land, which is more than the size of Dhaka city, according to a study of the CEGIS.River erosion has also been affecting two to three lakh families each year with one third of them becoming destitute, said experts at a discussion organised by The Daily Star at its conference room yesterday.The government doesn't pay much attention to the issue, and the victims never get much help from the state to find an alternative livelihood, they said.When chars emerge in the rivers where erosion is intense, social conflicts and violence become the way of life in the locality.“The rivers erode valuable productive croplands or townships.

SRI	severe respiratory infection	A powerful reminder of this, as well as of the fatal repercussions of the interspecies transmission potential of CoVs, was brought to the forefront in September 2012 by the emergence of a new SARS-like respiratory virus (previously termed HCoV-EMC, now designated Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV).^[@ref2],[@ref3]^ As in the case of SARS-CoV, the MERS-CoV is likely of zoonotic origin^[@ref4]^ and closely related to bat coronaviruses from the *Betacoronavirus* genus (group 2).^[@ref5]^ Reminiscent of the initial stages of SARS-CoV pandemic, global travel has contributed to the spread of MERS coronavirus, with a total of 178 laboratory-confirmed cases and a CFR of 43%.^[@ref6]^ The infected individuals display SARS-like symptoms, including a SRI, and sometimes exhibit an acute renal failure which is a unique signature of MERS infection.^[@cit2b],[@ref7]^ Today, a total of 6 human coronaviruses are known, of which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are recognized as highly pathogenic with the potential for human-to-human transmission.^[@ref8]^ Without an efficacious antiviral agent or vaccine, the prevention of current and emerging coronaviruses continues to rely strongly on public health measures to contain outbreaks.
HTS	high-throughput screening	These last two enzymatic activities result in the antagonism of the host antiviral innate immune response.^[@ref13]^ The SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors (compounds **24**([@ref14]) and **15g**,**h**^[@ref15]^), previously identified in our lab via HTS, have low micromolar inhibitory potency with minimal associated cytotoxicity in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells and are therefore viable leads for the development of drug candidates (Figure [1](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}).
H-bond	hydrogen bond	Detailed reports of the synthesis and biological evaluation of inhibitors **24**([@ref14]) and **15g**([@ref15]) and their X-ray structures in complex with SARS-CoV PLpro have been previously described.Compounds **24**, **15h**, and **15g** share a number of chemical and structural features (Figure [1](#fig1){ref-type="fig"}), including the presence of a naphthyl group adjacent to a stereogenic center containing a methyl group and a nitrogen-centered H-bond donor (at a physiological pH).

DUBs	deubiquitinating enzymes	However, to avoid drug-induced toxicity and potential side effects, it is crucial to maintain high inhibitory potency without cross-reactivity of critical homologues, the cellular DUBs.
USPs	ubiquitin-specific proteases	First, to assess compound selectivity, a set of the most potent analogues were tested against a panel of human DUBs, including representative USPs with structural similarity to PLpro, along with the human cysteine proteases caspase 3 and cathepsin K (Table [4](#tbl4){ref-type="other"}).
HCoV-NL63	human coronavirus NL63	All of the analogues in Tables [1](#tbl1){ref-type="other"} and [2](#tbl2){ref-type="other"} were counterscreened against the viral orthologue PLP2 enzyme from the HCoV-NL63, a member of the α-coronaviruses.
TI	therapeutic index	Because of their greater potency, all tested compounds displayed low cytotoxicity levels (CC~50~ \> 68 μM) with improved TI values in Vero E6 cell when compared to **15g**.
HSA	human serum albumin	The initial concentration of the parent compound was 1 μM.Half-life (minutes) of parent compound.Because the binding of an antiviral drug to human serum proteins may result in reduced antiviral activity,^[@ref24]^ we evaluated the plasma binding ability of the compounds in Table [6](#tbl6){ref-type="other"} by measuring the shifts in their IC~50~ values in various concentrations of human plasma protein (serum shift assays).^[@ref25]^ We observed no significant changes in the IC~50~ values for the compounds in the serum shift assays, which were performed in the presence of 5%, 10%, and 20% HSA (data not shown), the most abundant protein in human plasma (40 mg/mL).^[@ref26]^ This observation suggests that no specific interactions between the compounds and HSA take place.Conclusions {#sec3}===========A second-generation series of highly potent SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors was designed and evaluated biologically to further advance anticoronavirus drug development.
HSA	human serum albumin	None of these five compounds exhibit cytotoxicity or off-target inhibitory activity of a series of human DUB and cysteine protease enzymes, nor do any of these five inhibitors bind to HSA.

IS	immune synapse	Once an epitope is recognized, CTLs undergo a major rearrangement to form a transient contact site with the target cell, the IS.
CGs	cytotoxic granules	 CGs, vesicles that contain cytotoxic material like perforin and granzymes, are transferred along the cytoskeleton toward the IS and release their material upon fusing with the plasma membrane.
SNARE	soluble NSF attachment receptor	Because of the hazardous content of CGs, the fusion process is tightly regulated in space and time.Vesicular fusion is mediated by " SNARE" proteins.
FHL4	familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) type 4	They are also instrumental in mediating CG fusion with the plasma membrane at the IS ([@B5]), because e.g., mutations in the vSNARE Syntaxin11 lead to FHL4, a life-threatening immune disorder defined by the inability of CTLs to kill target cells ([@B6]--[@B8]).
PBMCs	peripheral blood mononuclear cells	Human PBMCs were isolated from 3 to 5 anonymous healthy donors per experiment (N) by density gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep; Axis-Shield).
SIM	structured illumination microscopy	For SIM, Alexa Fluor 647 anti-human Perforin (DG9; BioLegend), and anti-granzyme B (GB11; BioLegend) antibodies were used.
TIRF	total internal reflection microscopy	For TIRF monoclonal mouse anti-human anti-CD3ε (B-B11; Diaclone), monoclonal mouse anti-human CD28 (CD28.2; BD) antibodies were used for coating coverslips and stimulating cells.Plasmids and siRNA------------------VAMP3, VAMP4, VAMP7, and VAMP8 constructs were purchased from Addgene (42310, 42313, 42316, and 42311).
MFI	mean fluorescence intensity	For expression analysis, the pixel area and MFI were determined with Fiji v1.46 ([@B12]).Nucleofection of Expression Constructs and siRNA-Mediated Knockdown-------------------------------------------------------------------After 2 days of bead stimulation, 5 × 10^6^ CTLs were transfected with 1--2 μg of plasmid DNA (P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit, V4XP-3024; Lonza) Cells were imaged 10--12 h after transfection.
SIM	structured illumination microscopy	Lysates were sonicated, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and expression was analyzed by Western blotting. SIM----------------------------------------To conjugate CTLs with target cells, Raji cells (ATCC, CCL-86) were pulsed with 10 μg/ml SEA at 37°C for 30 min.
TIRF	total internal reflection fluorescence	For analysis of colocalization, Pearson\'s and Manders\' overlap coefficients were determined using the JACoP plugin of Fiji v1.46 ([@B12]). TIRF Microscopy--------------------------------------------------------The TIRFM setup from Visitron Systems GmbH (Puchheim, Germany) was based on an IX83 (Olympus) equipped with the Olympus autofocus module, a UAPON100XOTIRF NA 1.49 objective (Olympus), a 488 nm 100 mW laser and a solid-state laser 100 mW emitting at 561 nm, the iLAS2 illumination control system (Roper Scientific SAS, France), the evolve-EM 515 camera (Photometrics) and a filter cube containing Semrock (Rochester, NY, USA) FF444/520/590/Di01 dichroic and FF01-465/537/623 emission filter.
TeNT	tetanus toxin	 TeNT from the anaerobic *Clostridia* bacteria selectively cleaves VAMP1, VAMP2 (aka synaptobrevin2), and VAMP3 (aka cellubrevin), but not VAMP4, VAMP7 (aka TI-VAMP) ([@B14]), and VAMP8 ([@B15], [@B16]).
TIRFM	total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy	We then performed TIRFM to visualize and quantify fusion of individual CGs upon TeNT expression ([Figure 1C](#F1){ref-type="fig"}).
GzmB	granzyme B	Because only few paralog-specific antibodies for vSNAREs are available, we expressed fusion proteins of VAMP4, VAMP7, and VAMP8 together with a fusion protein of the CG marker GzmB in primary CTLs derived from human blood ([Figure 2A](#F2){ref-type="fig"}).
MAP	microtubule-associated protein	Third, in agreement with the lack of co-localization with LAT ([Figures 2G--I](#F2){ref-type="fig"}), we found no decrease in the phosphorylation of the MAP kinases Erk1 and Erk2 upon VAMP7 knockdown in Western blots with a phospho-specific antibody ([Figure S5](#SM6){ref-type="supplementary-material"}).

MW	Milky Way	These intriguing objects exhibit no appreciable gas components and tend to be clustered around the massive spiral galaxies MW and M31.
dIrr	dwarf irregular	In this context, the “tidal stirring” model of @Mayer_etal01 postulates that interactions with MW-sized host galaxies can transform late-type, rotationally-supported dwarfs resembling present-day dIrr galaxies into pressure-supported, spheroidal stellar systems with the kinematic and structural properties of the [*classic*]{} LG dSphs (see @Lokas_etal12a for an extension of this model to the newly-discovered ultra-faint dSphs).Previous work on tidal stirring has almost exclusively adopted cuspy, @Navarro_etal96 [hereafter NFW] density profiles to model the DM halos of the progenitor disky dwarfs.

ASR	automatic speech recognition	project[^1] provides a platform to study the impact of such spontaneous language alternation on modern ASR systems with the goal of building a robust ASR system that can handle this phenomenon.Impact of CS and other kinds of language switches on the ASR systems has recently received research interest, resulting in multiple approaches for CS acoustic and language modeling [@lyu2006; @vu2012; @wu2015; @weiner2012; @lyu2013; @li2012; @adel2013; @yilmaz2016_2; @westhuizen2017; @singh2018].
LM	language model	Using more monolingual Dutch speech for acoustic model training has found to be effective in improving the general ASR performance, only after increasing the in-domain CS data applying the semi-supervised techniques described in [@yilmaz2018; @yilmaz2017_2].Similarly, the proposed textual data augmentation aims to increase the amount of available CS text to train a CS bilingual LM that can more flexibly hypothesize language switches.

LCD	liquid crystal display	Discussion of the Related ArtAmong displays, a LCD is used in a wide range of applications including televisions, laptop computers, desktop computer monitors, and mobile phones.Since LCDs are not self-emissive, a light emitting apparatus to illuminate the liquid crystal panel is needed to display image information.Since the light emitting apparatus of an LCD is coupled to the rear surface of the liquid crystal panel, it is often called a backlight unit.
LED	light emitting diode	The backlight unit is an apparatus that forms a uniform surface light source and supplies the same to the backlight unit.A LED is structured by stacking an n-type semiconductor layer, a light emitting layer, and a p-type semiconductor layer on a substrate and forming electrodes on the p-type and n-type semiconductor layers.
BLU	backlight unit	The LED emits light when recombination of electrons and holes supplied from semiconductor layers occurs in the light emitting layer and thereby light is produced and emitted outside.LEDs may be used as a light source of a BLU by configuring an LED package.Since the as described above provides a surface light source to the liquid crystal panel, it may be viewed as an example of an apparatus for planar lighting.

NOSB	National Organic Standards Board	Now, more than six years later, Shamrock still has a pending appeal and is still selling milk in the Southwest undercutting ethical farmers and competitors that comply with federal organic law.“The inaction by the USDA places thousands of ethical family-scale farmers, who are competing with a couple of dozen giant dairies, at a competitive disadvantage,” said Kevin Engelbert, a New York-based dairyman, milking 140 cows who, along with his family, was the first certified organic dairy producer in the U.S.The Cornucopia Institute website maintains research-based scorecards rating all organic eggs, dairy products, soy foods, and several other food categories for their adherence to organic ideals, with the stated goal of “empowering consumers and wholesale buyers in the marketplace — accessing authentic food and rewarding the true heroes in the industry.”Engelbert, who also previously served on the USDA’s NOSB, stated, “When serving on the NOSB, I was always reminded that the recommendations we made to the National Organic Program (NOP) had to be scale-neutral.

NOP	National Organic Program	“Allowing these illegal dairies to continue to operate is a travesty and significantly undercuts the supply-demand dynamic that should be rewarding farmers in the marketplace and providing a decent living for our families,” Engelbert added.Although Cornucopia was critical of the USDA’s operation of the NOP during the Bush administration, it says it finds the current conduct of the Obama administration even more “insidious.” Engelbert, Cornucopia’s board vice president, continued, “The so-called ‘Age of Enforcement’ the organic community was promised, when the new administration took over in 2009, has been anything but with regard to large-scale ‘organic’ operations breaking the law.”During the Bush years the USDA was charged as being hostile to organic interests delaying the implementation of the law and then being recalcitrant in carrying out the will of Congress by enforcing the standards.“Since President Obama was elected they’ve greatly expanded the budget of the NOP, added competent staff, and said all the right things,” lamented Kastel.
structures	structure.” Cornucopia contends that this memo clearly suggests that enclosed porches	They are flagrantly breaking the law!”In addition to the published regulations, USDA Deputy Administrator Miles McEvoy issued a Policy Memorandum, on January 31, 2011, clearly stating, in terms of access to “outdoors,” that producers must provide livestock with “an opportunity to exit any barn or other enclosed (“structures”) do not meet the legal requirements for access to the outdoors but the USDA has been unwilling to enforce their clear interpretive statement.Cornucopia contends that consumers, who rightly assume that the animals producing their food are being treated respectfully, and consequently resulting in higher quality food, are being taken advantage of in the marketplace.The widely respected and nationally prominent organic dairyman, Kevin Engelbert, chimed in when addressing the controversy regarding chicken production with, “If you think a porch represents true access to the outdoors, when your children or grandchildren ask to play outside allow them to do so, but note their response when you say they have to stay on the porch.”In the case of the Horizon dairy in Paul, Idaho (WhiteWave), instead of the USDA sending its own agents to investigate complaints against the operation, the USDA sent in the same certifier that initially approved the operation to investigate alleged improprieties.“This is just unconscionable,” said Kastel.

3DPVS	3D printed vibratory scaffold	In this connection, a novel concept, namely the 3DPVS, has been put forward and justified via studying previous traditional scaffolds as well as by simultaneously penetrating the 'laws of system evolution' (LSE) into scaffold engineering.
3DP	3D printing	In brief, the concept of the 3DPVS indicates that a trinity of the separate elements of vibration, scaffolding, and 3DP would turn into a unified system with promising vibratory function and 3DP fabricability endowed by the scaffold itself.
3DP	3D printing	Vibration, as one core element inside the 3DPVS, has been indicated as one of the most useful types of dynamicity currently required by scaffold engineering, and 3DP, another core element, has been indicated as the technology bridging the gap between traditional scaffolds and future novel vibratory scaffolds.
GMBV	geometrical, mechanical, biological, and vibratory	Firstly, we will study several vital elements inside design initiation which will help prepare the general conceptual stage of the 3DPVS, after which the novel GMBV characterization of the 3DPVS will be analyzed, considering the GMBV as an unique design prospect of the 3DPVS compared with traditional scaffolds; thirdly, it comes to illustrating the base model of the 3DPVS and explaining the philosophy of the selecting process; finally, we will discuss the ideality of the scaffold, establish a possible ideal model of the 3DPVS, and briefly indicate the potential characteristics of such an ideal model.2.
aMEM	A-modified Eagle's medium	For the bone culturing environment, which is an important part of the base model, the following media could be selected, considering its high applicability in previous cell culture work and the bone-cell focus in this research context. aMEM (Bio-Whittaker, Belgium) containing 10--15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco™, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100--150 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1--0.2 mg/mL streptomycin (HyClone, UK), in a humidified atmosphere at 30--40 °C and 5--7% CO2\[4,10\].### 2.3.2.
ECCS	external cell culture scaffold	However, for the ECCS which is the focus of our research, this requirement is less essential because the ECCS, to which 3DPVS would belong, will initially be designed for cell cultivation without a further tissue-implantation process.
GMBV	geometric, mechanical, biological, and vibratory	[Figure 2](#biomimetics-04-00031-f002){ref-type="fig"} shows the three-level requirements and their relationships regarding three vital elements in the design initiation phase, that is, requirements, attributes, and components.On other hand, the fundamental properties of 3DPVS consist of four aspects, namely the GMBV characterization; in this connection, we could generate a structured list of input requirement, design attributes, and 3DPVS components, which will be analyzed using these four aspects in a similar way.

ACS NSQIP	American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program	The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence of symptomatic VTE following ACLR and to determine specific characteristics that may predispose a patient to the development of DVT or PE; to this end, we used the ACS NSQIP database.
CPT	Current Procedural Terminology	This database provides a highly accurate source of postoperative admission data, patient demographics, and medical comorbidities and has been validated for a large number of orthopaedic procedures to date, including ACLR.Data Collection {#section3-2325967118781328}---------------All cases from January 2005 to December 2014 with the isolated CPT code 29888 ("Arthroscopically aided anterior cruciate ligament repair/augmentation or reconstruction") were included.
HTO	high tibial osteotomy	Additionally, the following CPT codes were included if occurring simultaneously with ACLR: HTO (27457), medial or lateral meniscal repair (29882, 29883), or microfracture (29879).
BMI	body mass index	A number of patient demographic variables were collected, including age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status, operative time, type of anesthesia used during surgery (epidural, general or monitored anesthesia care, and regional blockade), and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class ranging from 1 (healthy patient) to 4 (potentially life-threatening medical disease).The primary endpoint assessed was the presence of DVT or PE (VTE) in the 30-day postoperative period.

UAH	University of Alabama in Huntsville	That's the first sentence of a July 29 Fox News article about a recent study which shows nothing of the sort, demonstrating just how broken climate change coverage is at news outlets like Fox, where scientific illiteracy meets political slant.Last week, Roy Spencer of the UAH, one of the few climate scientists who think we don't need to worry much about global warming, published a paperpurportedly challenging mainstream climate models that is both limited in scope and, by many accounts, flawed.
IPCC	Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change	You become one of those “deniers.”I was very annoyed when I saw the eulogy to Stephen Schneider in the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC.
IPCC	Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change	It reads in part;The Synthesis Report of the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC is dedicated to the memory of Stephen H. Schneider, one of the foremost climate scientists of our time.Steve Schneider, born in New York, trained as a plasma physicist, embraced scholarship in the field of climate science almost 40 years ago and continued his relentless efforts creating new knowledge in the field and informing policymakers and the public at large on the growing problem of climate change and solutions for dealing with it.
AGW	anthropogenic global warming	His life and accomplishments have inspired and motivated members of the Core Writing Team of this Report.The last sentence tells the story but only if you know the complete involvement of Schneider in the greatest deception in history.The dilemma for all these early advocates of AGW was that if they knew climatology, they knew that the work of the IPCC was corrupted science.
BGA	ball grid array	The same pattern can be witnessed with semiconductor packages, where the BGA is drawing attention because of its small size and ease of mounting advantage over other packages coping with a large increase in number of terminal pins.Among the BGA type packages, those using ceramic substrate are superior in their ease of face-down mounting and heat dissipation characteristics, and are thus most suitable for further miniaturization of packages especially for LSI's which dissipate a large quantity of heat due to high speed signal transmission in devices such as microprocessors.As disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Hei 8-88297, a ceramic type BGA package (C-BGA) is composed of a ceramic multilayer wiring substrate joined with solder balls.

ROS	raster optical scanner	Laser printers often use a ROS that sweeps a laser perpendicular to a process direction by utilizing a polygon or galvo scanner, whereas for cutting applications lasers imaging systems use flatbed x-y vector scanning.One of the limitations of the laser ROS approach is that there are design tradeoffs between image resolution and the lateral extent of the scan line.

NWS	National Weather Surface	In the hours following, there were at least seven large aftershocks, ranging in magnitude from 4.4 to 5.4, the USGS reports.The initial earthquake even shook buildings in Tokyo, some 240 km southwest of the epicentre.The U.S. NWS said tsunamis were not expected to reach the Pacific coasts of Canada and the United States.Located north of Tokyo, Fukushima prefecture was devastated by an offshore earthquake in March 2011.
HDFT	Harrogate District NHS Foundation Trust	Hollie BonePlans to launch an NHS-owned company to run the estates and facilities at Harrogate District Hospital have this week been proposed to staff in a consultation.Executive Board members at HDFT have started consultations to set up a ‘wholly-owned subsidiary’ with the aim of generating income for reinvestment into the Trust.The plan would affect just over 300 staff members involved in services such as catering, portering, and managing the car park.Chief Operating Officer at HDFT, Rob Harrison said: “It’s a wholly owned company by the Trust, it’s our thing, it’s not something we’re floating off into the private sector, it’s very much about retaining the ethos and the culture of how this organisation works but framing it within a company that focusses on actually doing what isn’t really core business for us as a hospital, what we’re here to do is to look after patients and that’s the focus.
ASDM	Alternative Service Delivery Model	"By having then the right structure and the right people involved in that it can also develop a bit of a commercial arm, so it can then generate new income streams from other work which then ultimately we can pile back into the Trust, because the profits from the company come back to the Trust.”The concept is not a new thing among NHS Trusts, and is technically referred to as setting up an ASDM.According to Executive Members at Harrogate, ASDMs have already been set up in Barnsley, Bolton, Blackpool, Gateshead and Airedale.The decision to set up an ASDM has not always proved popular, with the Yorkshire arm of the GMB Union slamming the move in Airedale.However, Mr Harrison, reassured that staff in Harrogate would not face any changes to their current employment conditions as a result of the plans.Instead, current staff will have the choice of remaining on their current NHS employment terms or to move over to the terms that new employees of the company will be offered.Deputy Chief Executive and Finance Director at HDFT, Jonathan Coulter, said: “The intention is, having consulted with the staff, at the end of November we will take the case back to the Trust board and say OK are we happy now pressing the button.
PUFA	polyunsaturated fatty acids	Effects of n-3 polyunsaturated dietary supplementation on the reproductive capacity of male turkeys.To measure the effects of dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation on the reproductive capacity of adult male turkeys in industrial flocks, the males of 22 commercial farms were fed either a standard diet or a fish oil diet enriched in n-3 PUFAs.
FA	fatty acid	The fish oil diet very effectively increased the percentage of n-3 FA (22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3) in spermatozoa and correspondingly decreased the percentage of n-6 PUFAs (20:4-6 and 22:4n-6): the n-3/n-6 ratio in spermatozoa were 0.04-0.07 with the standard diet and 0.32-0.4 with the fish oil diet.

U.S. management relationship from its tie to the Republic and in effect forming what appears to be a distinctively separate ‘Democratic Oligarchy’; which, if it were the government, would be repugnant to the Laws of this nation.In 1944, under The Bretton Woods Agreement, codified at USC Title 22 § 286, Corp. U.S.’ treasury was, in effect, given to the IMF as their individual drawing account; thus, giving the appearance of foreign control; however, Corp. U.S.’ President was also given the authority to control the IMF’s governors and general managers.Thus, from 1917, our nations original jurisdiction government (the Constitutional Republic) has been vacant.

SDSS	Sloan Digital Sky Survey	---abstract: | We produce and analyse [*u*]{}-band ($\lambda \approx 355$ nm) luminosity functions for the red and blue populations of galaxies using data from the SDSS [*u*]{}-band Galaxy Survey ([*u*]{}GS) and Deep Evolutionary Exploratory Probe 2 (DEEP2) survey.
DEEP2	Deep Evolutionary Exploratory Probe 2	---abstract: | We produce and analyse [*u*]{}-band ($\lambda \approx 355$ nm) luminosity functions for the red and blue populations of galaxies using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) [*u*]{}-band Galaxy Survey ([*u*]{}GS) and DEEP2 survey.
SFR	star formation rate	Submitted in original form 2008 November 13'title: 'Evolution of the [*u*]{}-band luminosity function from redshift 1.2 to 0'---\[firstpage\]surveys – galaxies: evolution – galaxies: fundamental parameters – galaxies: luminosity function, mass function – ultraviolet: galaxies.Introduction {#intro}============The evolution in the SFR of the Universe over the course of cosmic history is a measure of great importance that has many applications in various fields of astrophysics.
IMF	initial mass function	In addition to the obvious applications to the build-up of stellar mass in galaxies, other examples include constraining the stellar IMF [@Baldry03; @Wilkins08], testing models of chemical evolution in the Universe [@Calura04], constraints on the nature of both type Ia supernovae [@Strolger04] and gamma-ray bursts [@Dainge06; @Li08] and comparisons with global AGN activity and the growth of black holes [@Franceschini99; @Somerville08].SFRs of galaxies have been measured by a variety of methods, at different wavelengths.
UV	ultraviolet	These include: SFRs determined from the far- and mid-infrared produced by the re-emission of UV photons by dust grains, revealing hidden star formation [@LeFloch05; @Per-Gon05]; SFRs measured from radio emission produced by relativistic electrons in supernova remnants [@Condon92; @Seymour08]; Nebular emission lines such as ${\rm H_{\alpha}}$, ${\rm H_{\beta}}$ and ${\rm [OII]}$, produced by the recombination of ionized gas surrounding hot young OB stars [@Kennicutt83; @Moustakas06; @Cooper08; @James08a]; and X-ray emission produced by X-ray binary systems in late-type galaxies [@Norman04; @Lehmer08].More directly, SFRs have been measured from the UV luminosities of galaxies produced from short lived OB stars (lifetimes $\sim 10^{7}$ yr).
LFs	luminosity functions	This has to be accounted for.So far [*u*]{}-band field LFs have been produced by @Blanton03 for Data Release 2 (DR2) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main sample, by @Baldry05 for the SDSS [*u*]{}-band Galaxy Survey ([*u*]{}GS) and more recently by @Dorta08 using DR6, probing volumes out to $z \sim 0.2$.
DR2	Data Release 2	This has to be accounted for.So far [*u*]{}-band field luminosity functions (LFs) have been produced by @Blanton03 for DR2 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main sample, by @Baldry05 for the SDSS [*u*]{}-band Galaxy Survey ([*u*]{}GS) and more recently by @Dorta08 using DR6, probing volumes out to $z \sim 0.2$.

DEEP2	Deep Evolutionary Exploratory Probe 2	In this paper we extend the analysis to higher redshift, by combining samples of galaxies taken from the SDSS [*u*]{}GS and the DEEP2 survey, to produce LFs in the range $0.01 < z < 1.2$, which represents $\sim 8$ Gyr of cosmic history from when the Universe was $\sim 5$ Gyr old.
CMDs	colour-magnitude diagrams	We go on to produce CMDs from the data and make use of the observed colour bimodality [@strateva01; @Baldry04] to separate the narrow band of red, passive galaxies and blue star forming populations of galaxies.
DEEP2	Deep Evolutionary Exploratory Probe 2	Magnitudes are corrected for Galactic extinction using dust maps of @Schlegel98.Data====DEEP2-----The DEEP2 survey [@Davis03] is a redshift survey primarily designed to probe the properties of galaxies at redshift z $\sim$ 1.
EGS	Extended Groth Strip	field known as the EGS and three 1.0 sq.
SGP	Southern Galactic Pole	This consists of a $2.52^{\circ}$ wide strip across the SGP centred along the celestial equator from RA $-50.8^{\circ}$ to $58.6^{\circ}$.
EGS	Extended Groth Strip	In this paper we choose not to treat galaxies within the EGS separately from the other DEEP2 fields and an effect of this is the region of galaxies with low completeness (red) also seen in the figure.!
CMDs	colour-magnitude diagrams	This process enabled the production of rest frame [*u-g*]{} CMDs for the galaxies in 8 different redshift slices.
LF	luminosity function	[]{data-label="LFcompblue"}](f08.ps){width="47.00000%"}Results=======Luminosity functions--------------------The LF is defined as the number of galaxies per unit volume per unit luminosity interval ${\rm d}l$, or alternatively magnitude interval, ${\rm d}M$.
VVDS	VIMOS VLT Deep Survey	@Ilbert05 using first epoch data from the VVDS [@LeFevre04], measure an evolution in the faint end-slope of the [*U*]{}-band LF and find that it steepens from $\alpha = -1.05 \pm 0.05$ in the range $0.05 < z < 0.2$ to $\alpha = - 1.44 \pm 0.2$ in the range $0.8 < z < 1.0$.
VVDS	VIMOS VLT Deep Survey	In the next section we compare these values of $\beta$ with the results from other surveys at different wavelengths.Discussion==========Comparison between wavelengths------------------------------First we compare our results with those from the [*I*]{}-band selected VVDS [@LeFevre04].
FUV	far-ultraviolet	By combining the LD measurements of @Ilbert05 with [ *u*]{}-band SDSS main sample data from @Blanton03, we find that $\beta = 1.6 \pm 0.4$, which is greater than but consistent with our value of $\beta = 1.36 \pm 0.2$ for the combined galaxy sample.In the 150-nm FUV luminosity functions produced by @Arnouts05 using [*Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)*]{} satellite data combined with VVDS, $M^{*}$ was determined to brighten by 2 mag, using a sample of 1039 galaxies.
GALEX	Galaxy Evolution Explorer	By combining the LD measurements of @Ilbert05 with [ *u*]{}-band SDSS main sample data from @Blanton03, we find that $\beta = 1.6 \pm 0.4$, which is greater than but consistent with our value of $\beta = 1.36 \pm 0.2$ for the combined galaxy sample.In the 150-nm far-ultraviolet (FUV) luminosity functions produced by @Arnouts05 using [* GALEX*]{} satellite data combined with VVDS, $M^{*}$ was determined to brighten by 2 mag, using a sample of 1039 galaxies.
CFRS	Canada-France Redshift Survey	Our result along with the other more recent UV measurements rule out the early estimation of the NUV LD evolution by @Lilly96, who found a steep evolution of $\beta\sim 4$ using the CFRS.By going to longer wavelengths through optical to the NIR, the light sampled in galaxies is emitted by stars of increasing lifetimes.
NIR	near-infrared	These combined results also allow $\beta$ to be estimated for the [*V, R*]{} and [*I*]{}-bands, obtaining $\beta$ values of $1.00\pm 0.32$, $0.82 \pm 0.34$ and $0.59 \pm 0.34$ respectively.At NIR wavelengths, @Pozzetti03 found from a sample of 489 galaxies in the range $0.2 < z < 1.3$, that $\beta\approx 0.7$ in the [*J*]{}-band ($1.25 \mu$m) and $\beta \approx0.37$ in the $ K_{s}$-band ($2.17 \mu$m).
LIRGS	luminous infrared galaxies	The dust corrected evolution in the LD for the blue galaxies is essentially the evolution in the SFR density of the universe excluding dusty star forming [*red*]{} galaxies and possibly the most extreme objects with hidden star formation such as LIRGS.
LIRGS	luminous infrared galaxies	\[ALLrhoZplot\].Another possibility would be to take into account the dust attenuation of starbursting, LIRGS, for which our method for dust correction may be inadequate.

HSE	Higher School of Economics	The study was implemented in the framework of the Basic Research Program at the National Research University HSE in 2011.
PI	phosphatidylinositol	Polyhydroxy-mediated interactions between liposomes and bacterial biofilms.A theoretical model has been developed for the interaction of the surface polymers of the bacterial glycocalyx with liposomes incorporating lipids with polyhydroxy headgroups such as PI.
PI	polyhydroxy lipid	The most important prediction of the theory is that the potential energy of interaction goes through a minimum as a function of the PI concentration in the liposomal surface, thus predicting an optimal liposomal composition for adsorption of liposome to bacterium.

TATP	triacetone triperoxide	Authorities said on Saturday they discovered 2kg of powerful homemade explosives, TATP, and petrol bombs, acid, knives and metal rods on the premises, as well as anti-extradition bill banners.The route of Sunday’s march was originally meant to end at Hong Kong’s high court in the city centre to underline another demand – for a judge-led commission to investigate police use of rubber bullets, teargas and truncheons on unarmed protesters over the past few weeks.
CHRF	Civil Human Rights Front	Instead, police have ordered the rally organiser, CHRF, to conclude the march at an earlier point on the route, before reaching the city centre, which is close to the government complex.
FA	ferulic acid	A study some years ago examined the neuroprotective action of FA, a natural antioxidant.^[@ref1]^FA is a hydroxycinnamic acid prepared from rice bran.
FAD012	FA derivative 012	For reference, the solubility of FA is reported as 780 μg/mL.^[@ref5]^ Thus, FA was molecularly engineered to produce FAD012 with increased fat solubility and improved ability to traverse the central nervous system.^[@ref6]^ FAD012 has a chemical structure where a methyl group is substituted for the methoxy group in the aromatic ring of FA, and FAD012 is more highly fat-soluble and poorly soluble in water than FA, so FAD012 presumably has drawbacks limiting its full efficacy.
CD	cyclodextrin	Accordingly, if the solubility of FAD012 could be improved and a preparation retaining the antioxidative action could be devised, then FAD012 might serve as an active pharmaceutical ingredient that would be efficacious in treating cerebral infarction.A cyclic polysaccharide, CD, has glucose pyranose units linked with α-1,4-glucosidic bonds.
CA	caffeic acid	Various methods have been used to prepare inclusion complexes, such as coprecipitation,^[@ref9]^ kneading,^[@ref10]^ freeze-drying,^[@ref11]^ and cogrinding.^[@ref12]^ Cogrinding involves applying mechanical energy in the form of friction, grinding, etc., to a solid substance and changing its physicochemical properties; this mechanochemical technique forms inclusion complexes without needing a solvent.^[@ref13]^ The current authors previously used cogrinding to form CA and CD inclusion complexes, improving the elution of CA and retaining its antioxidant capacity.^[@ref14]^ FA is known to form inclusion complexes with CDs.^[@ref15],[@ref16]^ The physicochemical evaluation of the complex and the molecular interaction between FA and CDs in the inclusion state have been reported.^[@ref17],[@ref18]^ In other words, since FA forms a complex with CD, in this study, we attempted to prepare an inclusion complex with γCD using FAD012.Cogrinding techniques include the use of a rod mill, ball mill, or jet mill.
CE	complexation efficiency	When the CE was calculated using [eq [2](#eq2){ref-type="disp-formula"}](#eq2){ref-type="disp-formula"}, it was 0.62.
PXRD	powder X-ray diffraction	Therefore, PXRD measurement is useful for confirming changes in the crystal structure in the solid state.^[@ref27]^ Thus, PXRD was performed in order to examine the crystalline state of the 3DGM (FAD012/γCD) prepared by cogrinding using a 3D ball mill.
PM	physical mixture	The PM (FAD012/γCD = 1:1) produced a diffraction peak due to FAD012 at 2θ = 7.2° and a diffraction peak due to γCD at 2θ = 9.1° ([Figure [3](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}c).
3DGMw	3DGM with water	With the 3DGMw (FAD012/γCD = 1:1), the diffraction peak due to FAD012 disappeared and a new diffraction peak was produced at 2θ = 16.5° ([Figure [3](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}d).
3DGMnw	3DGM with no water	The 3DGMnw produced diffraction peaks due to FAD012 at 2θ = 6.9 and 11.5° and a diffraction peak due to γCD at 2θ = 8.8° ([Figure [3](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}](#fig3){ref-type="fig"}e).!
PM	physical mixture	](ao0c00277_0009){#fig9}Preparation of a Physical Mixture and a Ground Mixture {#sec4.2}------------------------------------------------------The PM was prepared by mixing FAD012 and γCD at a molar ratio of 1:1 using a vortex mixer for 1 min.
FAD012/γCD	FAD012 and γCD was prepared by grinding the PM	The ground mixture (3DGM) of FAD012/γCD (500 mg total) using a 3D ball mill with a 200 g ball of Φ5 mm for 60 min, and 300 μL of water was added (3DGMw) or not (3DGMnw).Methods {#sec4.3}-------### Determination of Complexation Stoichiometry {#sec4.3.1}The molar ratio of inclusion of FAD012 and γCD was determined according to Job's method (the method of continuous variation).^[@ref24]^ The ratio of FAD012/γCD concentrations was changed from 0.1 to 0.9, and the change in absorbance was plotted.
HPLC	high-performance liquid chromatographic	The apparent stability constant (*K*~s~) of the FAD012/γCD complex was calculated using [eq [1](#eq1){ref-type="disp-formula"}](#eq1){ref-type="disp-formula"} based on the slope of the solubility phase diagram and the solubility (*S*~0~) of FAD012 in the absence of γCD.### Quantitative of FAD012 with HPLC {#sec4.3.3}Solubility was quantified using a (HPLC: LC-20ADvp, Shimadzu Corporation) at a wavelength of 308 nm.
PXRD	powder X-ray diffraction	Therefore, the UV wavelength was set at 308 nm during the HPLC measurement.### PXRD {#sec4.3.4}The diffraction intensity was measured with a NaI scintillation counter using a Miniflex II powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo).
DSC	differential scanning calorimetry	Measurement was performed by placing a powder sample onto a glass plate so that the surface of the sample was flat.### DSC {#sec4.3.5}The Themo plus Evo high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimeter (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo) was used to perform DSC.
FT-IR	Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy	Calorimetry was performed by placing about 2 mg of the sample in an aluminum sealed pan and subjecting it to a nitrogen gas stream (60 mL/min) with temperature rising at a rate of 5.0 °C.### FT-IR {#sec4.3.6}Spectroscopy was performed with the JASCO FT/IR-410 (JASCO Corporation) using the KBr tablet method.
NIR	near-infrared	Background correction was performed using KBr single tableting.### NIR Absorption Spectroscopy {#sec4.3.7}A Fourier transformed near-infrared analyzer (Buchi NIR Flex N-500: Nihon Buchi) was used to perform NIR absorption spectroscopy.
SEM	scanning electron microscopy	Each sample was filled into a sample cup and measured with an optical path length of 1 nm.### SEM {#sec4.3.8}SEM was performed using a S3000 N scanning electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation).
ROESY	rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy	Each sample was subjected to gold deposition for 60 s and observed under a pressure voltage of 10 kV.### Measurement of ^1^H-^1^H ROESY NMR Spectra {#sec4.3.9}^1^H-^1^H ROESY NMR spectra were obtained using the NMR System 700 MHz (Agilent Technologies).
BrDs	bromodomains	PROJECT SUMMARY BRD4, a major BET (bromo and extra terminal) family transcription regulator, plays a pivotal role in ordered gene transcription in chromatin through its characteristic tandem acetyl-lysine binding BrDs.
TNBC	triple-negative breast cancer	We show that a conformationally optimized bivalent BET BrD inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits the tandem BrDs of BRD4 affords sustained repression of BRD4 transcriptional activity by blocking its association with enhancer/ mediator proteins with potency far superior to monovalent BET inhibitors, resulting in inhibition of proliferation of solid tumor cells including a panel of TNBC cells and even JQ1 resistant TNBC cells.

A_E	and the equality holds iff $v\in	Moreover, $0<F(v)\leq F_l(v)$ A_E_x\setminus A_x$.This can be computed directly by imposing that $(\tau,v)$ must be lightlike, i.e., $-\Lambda\tau^2+2\omega(v)\tau+g_0(v,v)=0$ and thus $$\label{tau}\tau=\frac{\omega(v)\pm\sqrt{\Lambdag_0(v,v)+\omega(v)^2}}{\Lambda} =\frac{g_0(v,v)}{-\omega(v)\pm\sqrt{\Lambda g_0(v,v)+\omega(v)^2}},$$ the first equality whenever $\Lambda\not=0$ and the last one valid even if $\Lambda$ vanishes whenever $v\neq 0$.
t,y	tau_F(x,y):=\inf\{t\in{\mathds R}: \, (0,x)\ll	So, the curve $\rho$ obtained by concatenating an $F$-admissible curve of length smaller than $\varepsilon$ from $x_n$ to $\bar x$ with the piece of $\gamma$ from $\bar x$ to $\bar y$ and with another $F$-admissible curve of length smaller than $\varepsilon$ from $\bar y$ to $y_n$ yields the required contradiction $d_F(x_n,y_n)<d_F(x,y)+3\varepsilon$.Although lower semi-continuity may not hold even in the conic Finsler case (and even with points $x,y$ at a finite $F$-separation, see [@JavSan11 Example 3.18]), we will check that this semi-continuity does hold in the Randers-Kropina case.Notice first the following straightforward consequence of Proposition \[bolas\].\[ctf\] For any [$\rm SSTK$]{}splitting with causal $K$, the function $$\tau_F:M\times M \rightarrow [0,+\infty], \quad \quad \ t,y\}$$ is equal to the $F$-separation function $d_F$.The function $\tau_F$ will be called the [*(future) arrival time function*]{} and its definition on $M$ instead of ${\mathds R}\times M$ uses implicitly the invariance of the metric with $t$.Next, we will prove the lower semi-continuity of $d_F$ by using results of spacetimes (which, in particular, extend those in [@sanche99]).
ii	in ${\mathds R}\times W_0$,	$F=F_l$ \\ {\footnotesize (and $C\rho=0$)}\end{minipage}}\right.$$\[existenceofbolas\] For every neighborhood $W_0$ of $x_0\in M$, there exists another neighborhood $U_0\subset W_0$ and some $\varepsilon>0$ such that $\hat{B}^\pm_\Sigma(x,r)$ is compact and contained in $W_0$ for every $r<\varepsilon$ and $x\in U_0$.The proof is a refinement of Lemma \[stronly\] obtained by taking into account that, given $W_0$ and considering the [$\rm SSTK$]{}splitting $({\mathds R}\times M,g)$ associated with the wind Riemannian structure, then the convex neighborhood $U$ provided by that lemma around $z_0=(0,x_0)$ can be easily chosen satisfying the following properties: (i) $U$ is included ii $U$ is precompact and (iii) $U$ contains the intersections $J^\pm(z)\cap ([-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]\times M)$ for some $\varepsilon>0$ and all $z$ in a smaller neighborhood $V\subset U$.
T,x	T>0: (0,x)\ll	If $M$ is compact then $(M,\Sigma)$ admits a closed (non-constant) geodesic.Consider the associated [$\rm SSTK$]{}splitting and define: $$T_0=\inf_{x\in M}\{T_0(x)\} \qquad \hbox{where} \qquadT_0(x)=\inf\{ T,x\}.$$ Notice that $T_0<+\infty$.

t+T_0,x	translation $(t,x)\mapsto	As $\gamma_0$ is a lightlike geodesic broken at $\gamma_0(1)$, we can modify it into a causal curve $\rho$ by putting a timelike segment from $\gamma_0(1-\varepsilon)$ to $ \gamma_0(1+\varepsilon)$ and making $\rho$ invariant under the t+T_0,x$ too.

QFI	quantum Fisher information	\[sec:concl\].\[sec:QFI\] QFI============================================Our whole analysis is centralized on the QFI which is a Riemannian metric in quantum geometry of state space [@Bengtsson06].
SLD	symmetric logarithmic derivative	QFI is defined as $\mathcal{F}^2(\rho, H)=\frac{1}{4}\mbox{Tr}(\rho L^2)$ where $L$ is the SLD operator which can be expressed as $\frac{d\rho}{dt}=i [\rho, H]=\frac{1}{2} (L\rho + \rho L )$.
CPTP	completely positive trace preserving	These properties such as convexity, invariance under the unitaries on both initial and final states, and monotonicity under CPTP maps, establish QFI as the fundamental quantity in quantum geometry, quantum information and quantum metrology.
lQFI	local quantum Fisher Information	\[fig:SpeedMeter\], where the first party, say $A$-party, is driven with the Hamiltonian $H_A=H_a \otimes \mathbb{I}$ the lQFI reduces to: $\mathcal{F}^2(\rho,H_A)= \mbox{Tr} \left(\rho H_A^2 \right) - \sum_{m\neq n}\frac{2 \lambda_m \lambda_n}{\lambda_m+\lambda_n}|\langle m | H_A | n \rangle |^2$ after simple manipulation of Eq.
CPTP	completely positive trace preserving	Following the properties of QFI [@Petz96], the $ \mathcal{Q}^2_A(\rho)$ acquires several interesting properties: it is nonnegative; invariant under local unitary operations; convex i.e., non increasing under classical mixing and monotonically decreasing under local CPTP maps on B-party; and in general $\mathcal{Q}_{A}^2(\rho) \neq \mathcal{Q}_{B}^2(\rho)$ except for symmetric quantum states.
CQ	classical-quantum	[**Theorem I:**]{} *$\mathcal{Q}_{A}^2(\rho)$ vanishes iff the bipartite states are either CQ i.e., $\rho=\sum_i p_i |a_i\rangle \langle a_i| \otimes \sigma_{iB}$ where $\langle a_i|a_{i^\prime}\rangle =0$ and $\mbox{Tr}(\sigma_{iB}\sigma_{i^\prime B})\neq0$ for $i \neq i^\prime$ or classical-classical (CC) i.e., $\rho=\sum_i p_i |a_i\rangle \langle a_i| \otimes |b_i\rangle \langle b_i|$ where $\langle a_i|a_{i^\prime} \rangle =\langle b_i|b_{i^\prime} \rangle =0$ for $i \neq i^\prime$.
CC	classical	[**Theorem I:**]{} *$\mathcal{Q}_{A}^2(\rho)$ vanishes iff the bipartite states are either -quantum (CQ) i.e., $\rho=\sum_i p_i |a_i\rangle \langle a_i| \otimes \sigma_{iB}$ where $\langle a_i|a_{i^\prime}\rangle =0$ and $\mbox{Tr}(\sigma_{iB}\sigma_{i^\prime B})\neq0$ for $i \neq i^\prime$ or - CC i.e., $\rho=\sum_i p_i |a_i\rangle \langle a_i| \otimes |b_i\rangle \langle b_i|$ where $\langle a_i|a_{i^\prime} \rangle =\langle b_i|b_{i^\prime} \rangle =0$ for $i \neq i^\prime$.
SVD	singular value decomposition	The real valued $M^2\times N^2$ correlation matrix $[\Gamma]_{mn}=\gamma_{mn}$ can be diagonalized, using SVD, to $U\Gamma V^T=\mbox{diag} [k_1,k_2,...]$ where $U$ and $V$ are the $M^2 \times M^2$ and $N^2 \times N^2$ orthogonal matrices, respectively.
QQ	quantum-quantum	On the other hand, if the bipartite state is either QC or QQ, it is impossible to find a local Hamiltonian $H_a$ with which the quantum states remain stationary in the projective space of $\mathcal{H}_A^M \otimes \mathcal{H}_B^N$ and thus, the $\mathcal{Q}_{A}^2(\rho)$ acquires non-zero value.
qCR	quantum Cram[é]{}r-Rao	For a single shot experiment, it is given by the celebrated qCR bound [@Braunstein94] as $\varDelta \theta \geqslant \frac{1}{\mathcal{F}(\rho, H)} $.!
gQFI	global (or joint) quantum Fisher information	In such case, the gQFI becomes $$\begin{split} \mathcal{F}^2(\rho,H_A+H_B)= & \mathcal{F}^2(\rho,H_A)+\mathcal{F}^2(\rho,H_B) \\ & + 2 \mathcal{C}(\rho, H_A, H_B), \end{split} \label{eq:GQFI}$$ where the third term (also called the interference term) $\mathcal{C}(\rho, H_A, H_B)= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{m \neq n}\frac{(\lambda_m-\lambda_n)^2}{\lambda_m+\lambda_n} \langle m | H_A | n \rangle \langle n | H_B | m \rangle$.
CCI	co-channel interference	Moreover, in addition to offering higher-quality communication and coverage, next-generation systems are desired to more efficiently use available bandwidth and to be priced affordably to ensure widespread market adoption.In many wireless systems, three principal factors tend to account for the bulk of performance and capacity degradation: multipath fading, delay spread between received multipath signal components, and CCI.
ISI	inter-symbol interference	It has been reported that when the delay spread exceeds approximately ten percent (10%) of the symbol duration, the resulting significant ISI generally limits the maximum data rate.
GSM	Global System for Mobile Communications	This type of difficulty has tended to arise most frequently in narrowband systems such as the GSM.The existence of co-channel interference (CCI) also adversely affects the performance and capacity of cellular systems.

TECs	thermoelectric coolers	Included among these are passive cooling devices, such as heat sinks and integral heat spreaders, and active cooling devices, such as TECs, fan heat sinks, refrigeration devices, multiphase cooling devices, and others.
TIM	thermal interface material	Yet, in order for any of these to effectively and efficiently cool a heat generating device, they must thermally couple with the heat generating device by some material or method having a relatively low resistance to the flow of thermal energy from the heat generating device to the heat dissipating device.Commonly, a TIM is used between the heat generating device and the heat dissipating device to aid thermal flow.
TDTT	thin die thin TIM	Likewise, other trapped gasses, such as flux volatiles, also interfere with efficient thermal flow in such assemblies.While voids present a problem in most applications, the problem is magnified in TDTT applications, because trapped bubbles tend to flatten out and occupy a larger percentage of the total bond line between devices, imposing a greater detrimental effect on the thermal flow from a heat generating thin die chip device to a heat dissipation device.

SCORE	Standardized Calculator of Risk for Events	The data from the questionnaires filled up by the physicians were analyzed to investigate the prescribing habits of NSAIDs and gastroprotective agents and to determine whether the physicians took any GI symptoms and the patient\'s own risk level into consideration when they prescribed medicine.The patients were stratified according to the risk of developing adverse GI events by using the SCORE tool.
HMO	health maintenance organization	The SCORE had been developed at Stanford University[@B1] and become the base of the treatment guidelines for the use of NSAIDs that was disseminated by northern California HMO.
H~2~	histamine~2~	Among the patients using the preventive drugs, 255 (32%) patients received rebamipide whereas H~2~-receptor antagonists (H~2~RA) were coprescribed for 191 (24%) patients ([Table 6](#T6){ref-type="table"}).Discussion==========The most frequent and significant adverse effect associated with NSAIDs is GI toxicity.
PPI	pump inhibitor	There have been disparities between medication guidelines and government\'s reimbursement policies which may modify the enthusiasm of some practitioners for gastroprotection.With regard to gastroprotective agents, proton PPI or misoprostol has been widely recognized as the most effective one[@B10].
coxibs	COX-2 inhibitors	Symptomatic low risk patients without evidence of blood loss may switch to another NSAID (or coxib) or receive treatment with antacids or H~2~RA[@B10].Selective coxibs are safer to the GI tract than traditional NSAIDs.
CV	cardiovascular	However, current prevention strategies for patients who need NSAIDs should also take into account the presence of CV risk factors, as coxibs and probably post traditional NSAIDs increase the incidence of serious CV events[@B2].
GI	gastrointestinal	Also, the ultimate choice of therapy for a particular patient depends on several things including risk factors, the preferences of the patient and the physician, and cost[@B10].Conclusions===========The physician prescribing NSAIDS for arthritic knees should monitor any developing GI symptoms or the level of patient\'s own risk for gastropathy, and be willing to add gastroprotective agents for the patient in order to prevent serious adverse events.###### The Prevalence of Risk Factors for GI Toxicity (n=1,960)!

ODF	Open Document Format	If your business had a mission-critical need to work with Microsoft's formats let's hope you weren't holding your breath for OpenOffice to come through for you.Is it fair to give an open-source project a hard time for taking three years to reverse engineer a document format more or less invented to make OpenOffice's life more complicated?Well, no, but in the real world Microsoft Office is - for better or worse - the moving target OpenOffice.org must aim for - and, in this case, taking quite a while to hit.Also on the document support front, OpenOffice 3.2 boasts improved compliance with ODF 1.2 standards as well as the ability to open password-protected Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files.Given that Microsoft's preview release of Office 2010 offers support for ODF files there's some small chance that OpenOffice might actually have an easier time integrating with Microsoft's Office in the future.The latest version of OpenOffice isn't all about format wars, though, and version 3.2 makes a worthwhile update for the considerable speed boost - especially in start up times.It's so fast, I no longer had time to grab a fresh cup of coffee while the suite came to life.

BCG	Bacille Calmette-Guerin	 BCG vaccination has limited efficacy in preventing pulmonary TB but can effectively reduce the risk of severe disseminated forms of TB and their sequelae in children \[[@C81], [@C82]\].
TNF	tumour necrosis factor	However, the evidence for epidemiological impact of LTBI screening and treatment is very weak \[[@C121]\].The risk of progression from LTBI to active disease is the highest for people with recent infection, such as TB contacts (especially children aged \<5 years), other recent converters such as healthcare workers undergoing serial testing, and people with impaired immunity due to comorbid conditions, including HIV infection, or immunosuppressive treatments, such as TNF-α inhibitors \[[@C120], [@C129]--[@C133]\].LTBI can be effectively treated, but the decision to test and treat should be taken after evaluation of the risk--benefit trade-off, and only those with the highest risk of progression should be considered for screening and treatment.

ANDA	Abbreviated New Drug Application	The Quest for a Generic Premarin – A Bitter Pill to SwallowThe story of the quest for a generic Premarin is an interesting one – one that dates back to the mid 1980’s when the FDA announced that Premarin was effective in combating the bone loss associated with osteoporosis.To this day an ANDA for a generic version has yet to be approved by the FDA – more than 20 years after two companies vying for a piece of the pie lost their bids to market a generic version of Premarin.The history behind the failure of the FDA to approve any generic version of Premarin is intriguing yet pretentiously motivated based on a so-called “impurity” named delta 8,9-DHES.Premarin’s patent expired in 1971 and until 1986, when the news of its efficacy in minimizing bone loss associated with osteoporosis was publicized, there was little to no interest from competing drug companies to produce a generic version of the drug.“There was not a large market for anyone to do anything about it until Premarin was granted the osteoporosis indication,” says Kenneth Phelps, vice president of clinical operations at Duramed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH).
ANDA	Abbreviated New Drug Application	[2]This opened the door for competing drug companies to submit ANDA for their generic versions.In 1991, six years after the announcement about the benefits of Premarin as an osteoporosis preventative, Duramed Pharmaceuticals submitted an ANDA for the approval of Cenestin – a generic version of Premarin.Around the same time another pharmaceutical company, Barr Laboratories, had also developed a generic version and were eager to compete in the lucrative market offered by this new revelation and the possibility of an untapped target audience.However the prospect of a generic entering the melee triggered a scientific debate that would persist for many years.Despite the fact that the generics appeared to be interchangeable with Premarin this was really not the case.To begin, the FDA discovered that Premarin had a slow-release bioavailability mechanism meaning that generic copies would need to have similar release characteristics to be considered bioequivalent.
DHES	dehydroestrone	This statement apparently went unnoticed by the FDA” [6]Despite this major setback for Duramed and Barr Laboratories, both companies, eyeing the tidy profits to be made from the potentially burgeoning market for the drug due to its ability to mitigate osteoporosis, forged ahead and developed new generics that would satisfy the estrogen requirements together with demonstration of bioequivalency.However in the interim Wyeth was already strategizing to protect their control of the HRT and newly-realized osteoporosis market.As a result of their clinical studies Wyeth-Ayerst filed a citizen’s petition in November 1994 requesting that the FDA designate delta (8,9) DHES a concomitant component of conjugated estrogens citing it as having a critical profile and that the FDA not approve any generic versions lacking this component.
NDA	New Drug Application	Duramed decided to submit a NDA for Cenestin which precluded it as a generic of Premarin – it is not a conjugated estrogen by compendial standard and is specifically called ”synthetic conjugated estrogens-A”.

DVB	Digital Video Broadcasting	Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing or OFDM is a technique adopted in many communication systems, such as WiFi, digital audio broadcasting (DAB) and DVB, including terrestrial (DVB-T) and handheld (DVB-H).
ISI	inter-symbol interference	OFDM has advantages over other techniques, advantages that include robustness against frequency selective fading and ISI caused by multi-path effect.
ICI	inter-carrier interference	OFDM techniques are particularly suited to support mobile channel communication, because OFDM techniques are able to address many problems related to mobile channels, problems that include linear distortions common in a mobile transmission, for example fading effects due to changes in antenna orientation or effects on the antenna such as placing an object (i.e., shadow) on the antenna.A transmitted OFDM signal is sensitive to frequency errors which can introduce ICI leading to degraded receiver or device performance (i.e., the receiver or device misinterprets a received OFDM signal, since the original transmitted signal has been affected).
PRL	prolactin	Pituitary and testicular function in spontaneously hypertensive rats.Levels of plasma gonadotropins, PRL, and testosterone, and the testicular concentration, total content, and affinity of hCG binding sites were measured in male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in genetically matched normotensive (WKY) rats.

ThAr	Thorium-Argon	We also collect fiber flats and ThAr arc frames for MINERVA, but these require opening the spectrograph and so are only taken during major instrument reconfigurations, years apart.
FAU	fiber acquisition unit	We also collect daytime sky exposures and check fiber guiding with a FAU.Raw Reduction Pipeline {#sec:pipeline}======================![image](fig2.eps){width="\textwidth"}!
ThAr	Thorium-Argon	We leave the result in raw counts, rather than performing an absolute flux calibration which can be challenging and uncertain [@suzu2003a; @hens2007a].In addition to the CCD calibration, we perform an initial wavelength calibration using a series of ThAr exposures taken on November 23, 2016, and an adaptation of the procedure described in @murp2007a.
HARPS	High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher	We first extract each arc calibration frame, then visually compare the emission lines to the HARPS atlas[^3].
PSF	point spread function	SP extraction also requires knowledge of the two-dimensional PSF across the CCD, which is challenging to determine to high precision.Reducing Calculation Time-------------------------The least squares solution to equation \[eqn:extraction\] is given by $$\bm{f}_{\lambda} = (\bm{P}^T\bm{N}^{-1}\bm{P})^{-1}\bm{P}^T\bm{N}^{-1}\text{D} \label{eqn:sp_soln}$$ where we drop the $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ variables for clarity.
DESI	Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument	We present here a different method, adapted from work performed by the DESI collaboration [@desi2016a Stephen Bailey and Nicolás Busca, private communication].

CART	Championship Auto Racing Teams	Auto Racing.American auto racing enjoyed a year of unprecedented prosperity and popularity in 1997, manifested in the inauguration of multimillion-dollar race tracks in California, Illinois, and Texas and the success of the Indy Racing League (IRL), the single-seater series born of the clash of wills between Indianapolis Motor Speedway management and CART.
NASCAR	National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing	Several race series sponsored by the NASCAR also continued to grow.Not only was the Indianapolis 500-mi classic, the world’s oldest motor race, held without the CART driving stars, but the IRL also proved its passenger car engine-based race-car formula was viable.
IMSA	International Motor Sports Association	Andy Evans, a Seattle, Wash.-area multimillionaire racer, bought the IMSA, changed its name to Professional SportsCar Racing (SportsCar), and was in the winning Ferrari 333 SP (with Stefan Johannsen, Fermin Velez, and Yannick Dalmas) at the 12 Hours of Sebring in March.

ASA	American Society of Anesthesiologists	Age, ASA class, surgical indication and primary symptoms were not different between the two groups.
IMI	intermeal interval	[@b6] On the other hand, when the IMI is fixed, the duration of the IMI may be critical in determining the extent of energy compensation[@b9] and be subject to the influence of preload characteristics, such as its physical form (i.e., liquid or solid).
SPSS	Statistical Package for the Social Sciences	In cases where preload weights and energy were not reported (\<2% of cases) the weight and energy of the taste foods or any preload component was estimated using the USDA National Nutrient Database release 24 (<http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/>).Data management and statistics------------------------------The SPSS Version 18 for Windows software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used to analyze the data.The dependent variable was %EC.
ECI	energy compensation index	The latter were grouped to allow sufficient sample size for the non-lean studies, which were underrepresented (see Results).To improve normality, the %EC variable was transformed using the function SQRT (squared root), after collapsing all negative and zero values into zero (as it was considered that a negative %EC and a zero %EC represents a similar behavioral outcome; i.e., the individual either did not respond to the preload energy or actually overate in response to it); the result is referred to hereafter as the ECI.
ED	energy density	 ED is a function of preload energy and preload weight, so ED was investigated in a separate model that did not incorporate weight and energy.
EC	energy compensation	[Mean (SEM) index in studies using IMIs of up to 30 min (*n* = 50), 30--120 min (*n* = 145), and \>120 min (*n* = 39) by preload physical form category\Only studies reporting positive EC are included.

TLB	translation lookaside buffer	More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method that selects a “way” (or “set”) of a cache based on data stored in a Memory Management Unit's TLB.2.
RMT	Real Memory Translation	If the compiler makes a mistake, data may be sent to the wrong cache set which may, as described above, impact performance if the cache is polluted or data used for real-time functionality is not readily available.Traditional RMT implementations use range registers that are based on effective address ranges and are associated with specific class identifiers that identify the cache set.
EAR	Effective Address Range	Another challenge facing this traditional approach is that the number of active RMT classes is limited to the number of EAR registers that have been architected into the hardware design.Another challenge facing the traditional approach is the difficulty in changing the RMT configuration of a system.
MMU's	management units	This inflexibility limits the Memory MMU's control over various memory units.
VMM	virtual memory manager	Imposing such compile-time constraints on cache-locking restricts the VMM from providing fine-grain control over the cache and, thus, may result in poorer performance.
p-1	-1 -	The following proposition follows from [@Kr Satz].\[prop:krieg\] If $n \geq 2$ we have $$\begin{aligned} \varphi(T_{n,0}(p^2)) &=& X_n \left\{\left(X_{n}^{ p-1p^{ X_{n}\right) \varphi(T_{n-1,0}(p^2)) \right.
p-1	-1 -	Furthermore, from a straightforward calculation we have $$\begin{aligned} \varphi(T_{0,1}(p^2)) &=& p^{-1} X_0^2 X_1,\\ \varphi(T_{1,0}(p^2)) &=& p^{-1} X_0^2 X_1 (p X_1^{ p-1 + pX_1).\end{aligned}$$ From Theorem \[thm:drei\] and the above relations, we have $$\begin{aligned} && p^{2nk+n-1} \left( p^{-k-n},\ p^{-2k-2n+2} \lambda_{g}(p^2) \right) A'_{2,2n}(\alpha_p)\\ &=& \left(\prod_{i=2}^{2n-1} \mu_i\right) (p^{-1} \mu_0^2 \mu_1,\ p^{-1} \mu_0^2 \mu_1 (p \mu_1^{ p-1 + p \mu_1)) B'_{2,2n}(\mu_2,...,\mu_{2n-1}).\end{aligned}$$ Hence, from the fact that the rank of the matrix $A'_{2,2n}(\alpha_p)$ is two, we obtain $$\begin{aligned} p \mu_1^{ p-1 + p \mu_1 &=& p^{-k-n+2} \lambda_g(p^2).\end{aligned}$$ On the other hand, we have $\lambda_g(p^2) = p^{k+n-2}(p \beta_p^2 + p-1 + p \beta_p^{-2})$.

PPE-DE	prevista per mercoledì alle 12.00.Heaton-Harris	Ripresa della sessionePresidente.Dichiaro ripresa la sessione del Parlamento europeo, interrotta giovedì 15 maggio 2003.Presidente.Ho una serie di comunicazioni che desidero trasmettere all'AssembleaPresidente.In merito al calendario delle tornate del prossimo anno ho ricevuto una proposta dalla Conferenza dei presidenti di tenere l'undicesima tornata da lunedì 3 maggio a giovedì 6 maggio 2004.Il termine per la presentazione di emendamenti a tale proposta è domani, martedì, alle 16.00.La votazione è PPE-DE.Signor Presidente, lei sta agendo nel rispetto della volontà espressa dal Parlamento sul numero delle tornate e in conformità delle votazioni tenute nelle precedenti sedute plenarie sulla sede di tali tornate, ma potrebbe confermare la sede della seduta del 1° maggio 2004?
PPE-DE	proposte in merito ad un'eventuale seduta in tale data.Lehne	Al momento non sono state presentate PPE-DE.Signor Presidente, desidero solo chiederle di verificare se, alla luce delle disposizioni vigenti, sia possibile tenere una tornata pienamente valida dopo il 1° maggio, poiché il nuovo Trattato di Nizza fissa a 732 il numero dei deputati.
PSE	prossima tornata.Barón Crespo	Sono state proposte le seguenti modifiche:Per quanto riguarda mercoledìIn merito alle interrogazioni orali al Consiglio e alla Commissione sul partenariato transatlantico, presentate a nome della commissione per gli affari esteri, i diritti dell'uomo, la sicurezza comune e la politica di difesa, propongo di prorogare i termini di presentazione come segue:proposte di risoluzione: giovedì 12 giugno alle 12.00emendamenti e proposte di risoluzioni comuni: giovedì 17 giugno alle 12.00.La proposta potrà quindi essere discussa e votata nel corso della PSE.Signor Presidente, la questione sollevata sull'ordine del giorno di mercoledì si ricollega al fatto che il Consiglio non parteciperà alla discussione sulle elezioni in Nigeria, cui sarà invece presente la Commissione.Non comprendiamo la ragione per cui, pur essendo presente in Aula, il Consiglio non partecipi ad un dibattito in cui presenterà la sua relazione proprio il presidente della delegazione di osservatori, l'onorevole Van den Berg, che è stato proposto per l'incarico proprio dal Consiglio.
PPE-DE	Presidente, ma anche senza il Presidente se questi non fosse disponibile.Poettering	Sottolineando quanto ha detto il collega Barón Crespo, ciò non sminuisce ovviamente l'opportunità di una valutazione più attenta cui si dovrà procedere dopo il Vertice di Salonicco e secondo la procedura che il Parlamento deciderà.In considerazione del carattere pubblico avuto dalla Convenzione, mi sembra politicamente opportuno che a discuterne siamo noi, anche se non per primi, almeno in modo pubblico e aperto, possibilmente in presenza del PPE-DE.Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, dopo aver esaminato la questione, il mio gruppo sostiene la proposta.
PPE-DE	programma della Conferenza dei presidenti di giovedì.Galeote Quecedo	Sostengo pertanto il suggerimento dell'onorevole Barón Crespo di inserire tale dibattito nel PPE-DE.Signor Presidente, vorrei che l'onorevole Barón Crespo chiarisse il nesso tra la questione del lino, attualmente oggetto di procedura giudiziaria in Spagna, e la questione Eurostat.
PPE-DE	prendere i provvedimenti del caso.Schierhuber	Credo che la signora Commissario dovrebbe PPE-DE.Signor Presidente, come molti cittadini, accolgo con grande preoccupazione la decisione del Congresso americano di concedere un pacchetto di aiuti di 15 miliardi di dollari a condizione che i paesi africani destinatari accettino forniture di generi alimentari geneticamente modificati.
ELDR	europea che stiamo attualmente cercando di creare.Wallis	Credo che, se adottassimo la proposta del relatore, se anche la Commissione la adottasse e, in particolare, come ha detto l'onorevole Lehne, se il Consiglio la adottasse, potremmo presto disporre di uno statuto che consentirà effettivamente ai deputati europei di differenziarsi dai parlamentari nazionali, con un proprio statuto che sarebbe appropriato per il genere di Unione ELDR.Signor Presidente, spero che non dovremo tornare qui per parlare ancora delle nostre condizioni di lavoro.
NI	nostri interessi personali.Dell'Alba	Venticinque anni dopo le prime elezioni a suffragio universale, è arrivato il momento di sciogliere il nodo gordiano; è ormai giunto il momento di anteporre l'interesse dei lavori del Parlamento ai NI.Signor Presidente, colleghi, come tutti voi sapete, la questione dello Statuto dei deputati è all'ordine del giorno del nostro Parlamento ormai da moltissimi anni e, come altri colleghi, dubito anch'io che, nonostante il voto di domani, si riesca a giungere - ma me lo auguro, naturalmente - a un risultato finale sotto la sua presidenza, Presidente Cox.
PSE	prese.Berenguer Fuster	Onorevoli colleghi, insieme ai rappresentati degli Stati membri, vi invito a non aver paura di prendere decisioni e a non temere per le decisioni che potrebbero essere PSE.Signor Presidente, sembra che questa volta stiamo veramente compiendo dei progressi e stiamo quindi facendo un passo importante per risolvere una delle anomalie più clamorose che caratterizzano il funzionamento di quest'Assemblea, realizzando una cosa molto semplice: tutti gli Stati membri saranno soggetti allo stesso sistema.Inutile dire che il testo proposto dal relatore, onorevole Rothley - con cui mi congratulo vivamente - è equilibrato e ovviamente gli offriremo il nostro incondizionato sostegno.
PPE-DE	posso promettere - ma anche su quello dell'intera Assemblea.Mombaur	E' necessario potervi applicare gli strumenti del Trattato, soprattutto in materia di sussidi di Stato e di controllo delle fusioni e credo che in questo ambito la Commissione possa contare sul sostegno politico non solo del mio gruppo - questo lo PPE-DESignor Presidente, innanzitutto devo fare una dichiarazione al di fuori del mio tempo di parola, in quanto sostituisco il relatore della commissione competente.Gli elenchi per la votazione di mercoledì che finora sono stati distribuiti sono errati, o perlomeno fuorvianti.
NI	non ci siano problemi.Kronberger	Speriamo che tutti agiscano correttamente e che domani NIAssoggettare il mercato interno dell'energia elettrica e del gas naturale a norme applicabili in tutta Europa è un approccio fondamentalmente corretto.
Verts/ALE	vertono sulla liberalizzazione e sulla privatizzazione.Ahern	Il nostro gruppo avrebbe voluto salvaguardare il carattere pubblico ed universale dei servizi energetici in relazione a queste direttive che Verts/ALE.Signor Presidente, vorrei porgere le mie più vive congratulazioni a tutti coloro che hanno contribuito al grande lavoro di portare queste relazioni ad una conclusione coerente, positiva e persino solida.In particolare, accolgo con favore le richieste di assoggettare pienamente i fondi di disattivazione alle norme comunitarie sulla concorrenza.
CE	che abroga il regolamento	In particolare, desidero ringraziare il Parlamento, i tre relatori principali, ma anche l'onorevole Clegg e tutti i relatori ombra, e congratularmi con loro per il lavoro svolto che, anche se le nostre mete avrebbero potuto essere più ambiziose, ha prodotto risultati eccellenti.Presidente.La ringrazio molto, signora Commissario de Palacio.La discussione è chiusa.La votazione si svolgerà mercoledì, alle 12.00.Presidente.L'ordine del giorno reca la relazione (A5-0144/2003), presentata dall'onorevole Piecyk a nome della commissione per la politica regionale, i trasporti e il turismo, sulla proposta di regolamento del Parlamento europeo e del Consiglio che modifica il regolamento CE n. 417/2002 sull'introduzione accelerata delle norme in materia di doppio scafo o di tecnologia equivalente per le petroliere monoscafo e CE n. 2978/94 del Consiglio [COM(2002) 780 - C5-0629/2002 - 2002/0310(COD)].de Palacio, LoyolaSignor Presidente, onorevoli deputati, il naufragio della petroliera Prestige avvenuto al largo delle coste galiziane il 18 novembre scorso ha chiaramente dimostrato, ancora una volta, le carenze della legislazione internazionale sulla sicurezza marittima che regola specificamente il trasporto di petrolio via mare.In particolare, questo incidente ha messo in evidenza l'urgente necessità di adottare le misure presentate dalla Commissione dopo un altro incidente simile, che a suo tempo aveva coinvolto l'Erika.
PPE-DE	popoli ed infine ad eliminare la povertà.Schwaiger	Contemporaneamente, però, la commissione per lo sviluppo e la cooperazione giudica ritiene vitale armonizzare multilateralismo e regionalismo, cioè le norme fissate dall'OMC per la liberalizzazione del commercio regionale e lo sviluppo delle zone di libero scambio - compreso il moltiplicarsi di accordi fra paesi e regioni con livelli di sviluppo assai differenti -, poiché è convinta che solo in tal modo, perseguendo tale armonia, riusciremo a fare delle relazioni commerciali un autentico fattore di sviluppo per tutti i PPE-DE.Signor Presidente, signor Commissario Lamy, onorevoli colleghi, desidero esprimere il sostegno convinto del gruppo PPE-DE per la relazione dell'onorevole Mann sulle zone di libero scambio regionali e la strategia commerciale nell'Unione europea.Consentitemi di aggiungere alcune osservazioni.
PPE-DE	potrà evolversi solo qualora, nel processo decisionale, la maggioranza sostituisca l'unanimità.Sacrédeus	La base giuridica è difettosa, troppo farraginosa e complicata; essa raggiunge tuttavia i propri destinatari e noi non vogliamo che i paesi interessati - anche pensando alle speranze che essi ripongono nella capacità dell'Europa di assisterli - siano delusi da polemiche certamente giustificate ma meschine rispetto alle loro speranze.Confidiamo dunque nella saggezza del Parlamento per affrontare insieme le difficoltà che sperimentiamo nel convivere con uno strumento che PPE-DESignor Presidente, in qualità di relatore per parere della commissione per gli affari esteri, i diritti dell'uomo, la sicurezza comune e la politica di difesa, desidero ringraziare di cuore l'onorevole Belder per la sua relazione e per l'altissimo livello del suo contributo.
PSE	proporre immediatamente queste misure.McNally	La Commissione dovrebbe PSE.Signor Presidente, mi congratulo con il relatore, onorevole Belder, ed anche con la Commissione europea per l'interessante relazione sul 2001.
PSE	progressi.De Keyser	E' un risultato positivo, che sprona la Commissione a proseguire in questa direzione assieme ai servizi che hanno cooperato a questo scopo; non dubitiamo che il Parlamento, quando esaminerà gli anni 2001 e 2002, potrà constatare ulteriori PSESignor Presidente, signor Commissario, l'onorevole Piétrasanta ed io abbiamo collaborato in perfetta armonia; non vi sorprenderà quindi di ritrovare la medesima impostazione nel breve intervento che mi accingo a pronunciare.Il parere della commissione per gli affari esteri, i diritti dell'uomo, la sicurezza comune e la politica di difesa si articolava su diversi punti, due dei quali rivestivano per noi particolare importanza.Il primo - sul quale lei, signor Commissario, ci ha rassicurato - riguardava la necessità di vigilare sul rispetto delle clausole democratiche negli accordi di associazione, nonché la necessità di una trasparente e regolare verifica dell'impatto del programma MEDA sui diritti umani: tutto questo si fonda su una relazione annuale redatta dalla Commissione in base a criteri chiari, ad un calendario preciso ed alla formazione in questo settore dei funzionari europei.Il secondo punto verteva sull'importanza di creare in questi paesi mediterranei una società civile aperta e tollerante, soprattutto sostenendo l'indipendenza delle piccole ONG.
PPE-DE	passo e rappresenti un autentico segno di speranza.Fiori	Speriamo che l'adozione della road map da parte del quartetto per il Medio Oriente sia il primo PPE-DE.Signor Commissario, la ringraziamo per i due punti politici che lei ha richiamato.
PSE	potrebbero trovare una soluzione.Zrihen	Nel quadro delle situazioni che lei, Commissario, ha alla sua attenzione poniamo la necessità, proprio per ragioni di politica estera e di ruolo dell'Unione europea, di insistere su una conclusione dei negoziati Siria/UE, al fine di completare la rete di accordi di associazione euromediterranei, come dobbiamo procedere quanto prima alla selezione dei progetti di pianificazione dei programmi finanziari attualmente in sospeso fra Israele e Palestina, giacché potrebbero giocare un ruolo molto importante in questa aerea del Mediterraneo.Chiudo con un accento: abbiamo la necessità di un'Assemblea parlamentare, perché questo è il luogo politico nel quale probabilmente molti dei processi in atto PSE.Signor Presidente, signor Commissario, onorevoli colleghi, sette anni dopo la conferenza di Barcellona che ha visto l'avvio del partenariato Euromed, al Parlamento europeo si offre, con la relazione dell'onorevole Piétrasanta, l'opportunità di fare il punto su MEDA, strumento finanziario di tale politica.
PPE-DE	prospettiva, sotto l'attento sguardo della Commissione.Gutiérrez-Cortines	Continueremo dunque, nel corso dei prossimi anni, a compiere le nostre valutazioni in questa PPE-DE.Signor Presidente, desidero congratularmi con l'onorevole Piétrasanta ed anche con la Commissione.

IDF	Israel Defense Forces	intervention into Libya an ominous precedent for Israel,” Gaffney spells out a possible scenario whereby an international coalition, including the U.S., could militarily threaten Israel just as it is striking Libya.Such a resolution seeks international legal recognition for a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders, meaning inside the Gaza Strip, West Bank and eastern sections of Jerusalem, technically including the Temple Mount.While it is not yet clear whether the Obama administration will ultimately support such a move, PA officials told WND on numerous occasions the U.S. has indicated it may not veto a U.N. vote to declare a Palestinian state.In a previous WND interview, Ahmed Qurei, former PA prime minister and member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee, said the PA “reached an understanding with important elements within the (Obama) administration” to possibly bring the resolution to the U.N. Security Council.Asked to which “elements” he was referring, Qurei would only say they were from the Obama administration.A top PA negotiator, speaking to WND on condition of anonymity, named the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Susan Rice, and National Security Council member Samantha Power as among the Obama administration officials who were involved with the Palestinians’ U.N. threat.“The U.S. told us that they prefer a negotiated settlement with Israel, but if we (Palestinians) insist on a resolution, the Americans will not necessarily reject it,” the PA negotiator said.“The U.S. has a history of never before vetoing any U.N. move to create a new state,” the negotiator pointed out.Should the U.N. unilaterally declare a Palestinian state, Gaffney warns, the move may put the U.S. and Israel on a military collision course.Writes Gaffney: “With a stroke of the U.N.’s collective pen, substantial numbers of IDF and Israeli citizens find themselves on the wrong side of internationally recognized borders.
PA	Palestinian Authority	The PA insists on its longstanding position: The sovereign territory of Palestine must be rid of all Jews.”Gaffney envisions a scenario in which Israel refuses to evacuate its Jewish communities and military stations from the newly recognized Palestinian state, leading the PA to seek international help to “liberate” its so-called land.Another scenario not directly pointed to by Gaffney could involve the PA asking the international community for help to oppose any future Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip or West Bank should the U.N. unilaterally impose a Palestinian state there.“As with the Gaddafi Precedent,” Gaffney predicts, “the first to act is the Arab League.

GAI	geographical area of interest	For example, marine techniques send energy waves into the earth by first generating the energy waves in or on the ocean.One way to perform marine seismic acquisitions or surveys is to tow an array of seismic receivers, which may be disposed on elongated streamers, by a vessel over the GAI and to generate source signals with one or more sources (towed by said vessel or a dedicated vessel which tows only the sources), and receive corresponding reflections while traversing the GAI.
RFID	radio frequency identification	Another scheme involves placing RFID tags on one or more element(s) on a streamer.

PAMPs	pattern-associated molecular patterns	Introduction {#s1}============The recognition of virus-specific PAMPs is a pivotal event in the initiation of the host innate response to infection.
RIG-I	retinoic acid-inducible gene I	However, most viruses produce proteins that antagonize and effectively delay signaling by the primary viral oligonucleotide sensor molecules RIG-I and melanoma differentiation--associated gene 5 (MDA5), allowing the virus to replicate to high titers and produce large amounts of danger signals prior to host intervention [@ppat.1003703-Moltedo1], [@ppat.1003703-Zhao1].
MDA5	melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5	However, most viruses produce proteins that antagonize and effectively delay signaling by the primary viral oligonucleotide sensor molecules retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and MDA5, allowing the virus to replicate to high titers and produce large amounts of danger signals prior to host intervention [@ppat.1003703-Moltedo1], [@ppat.1003703-Zhao1].
DI	defective interfering	DVGs with the ability to interfere with standard virus replication were first described by Von Magnus in the early 1950s as the genomes of incomplete forms of influenza virus called DI viral particles [@ppat.1003703-VonMagnus1].
SeV	Sendai virus	However, the biological role of DVGs in the context of natural infections is not well understood.We and others have shown that stocks of SeV with a high content of copy-back DVGs with interfering activity trigger enhanced production of cytokines *in vitro* and more potently induce antigen presentation by mouse and human dendritic cells than do virus stocks lacking this kind of DVGs [@ppat.1003703-Johnston1], [@ppat.1003703-Marcus1], [@ppat.1003703-Strahle1], [@ppat.1003703-Yount1], [@ppat.1003703-Yount2], [@ppat.1003703-Shingai1].
DVG-546	DVG of 546 nt in length	Cloning and sequencing of the 278 nt long amplicon confirmed that it corresponded to a previously described SeV Cantell copy-back DVG-546 [@ppat.1003703-Strahle2].
NDV	Newcastle disease virus	In contrast, type I IFN signaling was required for the cellular response to NDV, an avian virus that only partially inhibits the type I IFN pathway, triggering the expression of type I IFN and other cytokines in the absence of DVGs.!
rDVG	recombinant DVG	](ppat.1003703.g001){#ppat-1003703-g001}To further validate the role of SeV copy-back DVGs as triggers of type I IFN-independent antiviral responses, we cloned DVG-546 under the control of the T7 polymerase promoter and used this construct to prepare a SeV stock containing a single rDVG.
RLRs	RIG-I-like receptors	These data demonstrate that DVGs rapidly surpass the number of gSeV in infected cells, providing large quantities of pathogen associated molecular patterns.Supporting previous observations that DVGs from SeV stimulate the cellular antiviral response through signaling by RLRs [@ppat.1003703-Baum1], [@ppat.1003703-Yount1], [@ppat.1003703-Yount2], the essential RLR adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) was required for the activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB and for expression of numerous antiviral and pro-inflammatory molecules upon infection with SeV Cantell HD.
MAVS	mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein	These data demonstrate that DVGs rapidly surpass the number of gSeV in infected cells, providing large quantities of pathogen associated molecular patterns.Supporting previous observations that DVGs from SeV stimulate the cellular antiviral response through signaling by RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) [@ppat.1003703-Baum1], [@ppat.1003703-Yount1], [@ppat.1003703-Yount2], the essential RLR adaptor protein MAVS was required for the activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB and for expression of numerous antiviral and pro-inflammatory molecules upon infection with SeV Cantell HD.

TYMV	turnip yellow mosaic virus	DRB4 and DCL4 collectively participate in TYMV-derived siRNA production and antiviral responses \[[@B108-cells-08-00038]\], but in the absence of DRB4, other members of this family might assist DCL4 in the biogenesis of 21 nt vsiRNA \[[@B109-cells-08-00038]\].

IPDE	integro-partial differential equation	'author:- '**Lorenzo Marino**[^1] [^2]'bibliography:- 'bibli.bib'title: | **Schauder estimates for degenerate stable\ Kolmogorov equations**---Introduction============For a fixed time horizon $T>0$ and two integers $n,d$ in $\N$, we are interested in proving global Schauder estimates for the following parabolic IPDE: $$\label{Degenerate_Stable_PDE}\begin{cases} \partial_t u(t,\bm{x}) + \langle A \bm{x} + \bm{F}(t,\bm{x}), D_{\bm{x}}u(t,\bm{x})\rangle +L_\alpha u(t,\bm{x}) \, = \, -f(t,\bm{x}), & \mbox{on } [0,T]\times \R^{nd} \\ u(T,\bm{x}) \, = \, g(\bm{x}) & \mbox{on }\R^{nd}.
SDE	stochastic differential equation	Moreover, the Schauder estimates will be a fundamental first step in order to study the weak and strong well-posedness for the following SDE: $$\label{SDE_Associated}\begin{cases} d\bm{X}^1_t \, = \, \bm{F}_1(t,\bm{X}^1_t,\dots,\bm{X}^n_t)dt +dZ_t \\ d\bm{X}^2_t \, = \, A_{2,1}\bm{X}^1_t+\bm{F}_2(t,\bm{X}^2_t,\dots,\bm{X}^n_t)dt \\ \vdots \\ d\bm{X}^n_t \, = \, A_{n,n-1}\bm{X}^{n-1}_t+\bm{F}_n(t,\bm{X}^n_t)dt\end{cases}$$ where $Z_t$ is a symmetric, $\R^d$-valued $\alpha$-stable process with non-degenerate Lévy measure $\nu_\alpha$ on some filtered probability space $(\Omega,(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\ge0},\mathbb{P})$.
s-t	s-t}\, := \,	Fixed $i$ in $\llbracket1,n\rrbracket$, we then denote for simplicity $$\mathbb{T}_{ s-t^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}\mathbb{M}_{s-t}$$ and we calculate the derivative of $\tilde{p}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}$ with respect to $\bm{x}_i$ through $$\begin{gathered}\vert D_{\bm{x}_i}\tilde{p}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}(t,s,\bm{x},\bm{y}) \vert \, = \, \Bigl{\vert} \frac{1}{\det (\mathbb{M}_{s-t})} D_{\bm{x}_i} \bigl[p_S\bigl(s-t,\mathbb{M}^{-1}_{s-t} (\tilde{\bm{m}}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}_{t,s}(\bm{x})-\bm{y})\bigr)] \Bigr{\vert} \\= \, \Bigl{\vert} \frac{1}{\det(\mathbb{T}_{s-t})}D_{\bm{x}_i}\bigl[p_S\bigl(1,\mathbb{T}^{-1}_{s-t}(\tilde{\bm{m}}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}_{t,s}(\bm{x})-\bm{y})\bigr)] \Bigr{\vert} \\= \,\Bigl{\vert} \frac{1}{\det (\mathbb{T}_{s-t})} D_{\bm{z}}p_S\bigl(1,\cdot\bigr)(\mathbb{T}^{-1}_{s-t}(\tilde{\bm{m}}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}_{t,s}(\bm{x})-\bm{y}))\mathbb{T}^{-1}_{s-t}D_{\bm{x}_i}(\tilde{\bm{m}}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}_{t,s}(\bm{x})) \Bigr{\vert}.\end{gathered}$$ where in the second equality we exploited the $\alpha$-scaling property .
t,\bm{x}	tau,\bm{\xi}}(s,\bm{x})\bigr] \, ds, \quad	Above, we have denoted $$\label{eq:def_remainder_regul}R_m^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}t,\bm{x}\,:=\, \langle \bm{F}_mt,\bm{x}-\bm{F}_m(t,\bm{\theta}^m_{\tau,t}(\bm{\xi})),D_{\bm{x}}u_mt,\bm{x}\rangle.$$we can use the Duhamel Formula (Proposition \[prop:frozen\_Duhamel\_Formula\]) for the proxy to write that $$u_mt,\bm{x} \, = \, \tilde{P}^{m,\tau,\bm{\xi}}_{t,T}g_m(\bm{x}) + \int_{t}^{T}\tilde{P}^{m,\tau,\bm{\xi}}_{t,s}\bigl[f_m(s,\bm{x})+R_m^{\ t,\bm{x} \, \in \, (0,T)\times\R^{nd}$$ where $\Bigl(\tilde{P}^{m,\tau,\bm{\xi}}_{t,s}\Bigr)_{t\le s}$ is the semigroup associated with the operator $L_\alpha+\langleA\bm{x}+\bm{F}_m(t,\bm{\theta}^m_{\tau,t}(\bm{\xi})),D_{\bm{x}} \rangle$.The reasoning above is summarized in the following Duhamel-type formula that allows to expand any classical solution $u_m$ of the “regularized” IPDE along the “regularized frozen” proxy.\[prop:Expansion\_along\_proxy\] Let $(\tau,\bm{\xi})$ a freezing couple in $[0,T]\times\R^{nd}$.
t,\bm{x}	tau,\bm{\xi}}(s,\bm{x})\,ds, \quad	Under (**A**), any classical solution $u_m$ of the “regularized” IPDE can be represented as $$\label{eq:Expansion_along_proxy}u_mt,\bm{x} \, = \, \tilde{u}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}_mt,\bm{x} + \int_{t}^{T} \tilde{P}^{m,\tau,\bm{\xi}}_{t,s}R^{m,\ t,\bm{x} \, \in \, (0,T)\times\R^{nd}$$ where $R_m^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}$ is as in and $\tilde{u}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}_m$ is defined through the Duhamel representation with the “regularized” coefficients $f_m$, $g_m$.Thanks to the above representation (Equation ), we know that, since we have already shown the suitable control for the frozen solution $u^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}_m$ (namely, Proposition \[prop:Schauder\_Estimates\_for\_proxy\] with $f_m,g_m$), the main term which remains to be investigated in order to show the Schauder Estimates (Theorem \[theorem:Schauder\_Estimates\]) is the remainder $$\label{eq:qqq} \int_{t}^{T}\tilde{P}^{m,\tau,\bm{\xi}}_{t,s}R_m^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}(s,\bm{x}) \, ds,$$ that represents exactly the error in the expansion along the proxy.To be precise, we could have passed to the limit in Equation in order to obtain a similar Duhamel-type formula for a mild solution $u$ in $L^\infty\bigl([0,T];C^{\alpha+\beta}_{b,d}(\R^{nd})\bigr)$.
T-t	that $$\vert(\bm{x}-\bm{x})_1\vert	From equations , and , it is possible to conclude that $$\begin{gathered}\bigl{\vert}D_{\bm{x}_1}\tilde{P}^{\bm{\xi}}_{t,T}g(\bm{x}) - D_{\bm{x}_1}\tilde{P}^{\bm{\xi}}_{t,T}g(\bm{x}') \bigr{\vert}\, \le \, C\Vert g\Vert_{ C^{\alpha+\beta}_{b,d}}\vert (\bm{x}-\bm{x}')_1 \vert\sum_{j=1}^n T-t^{j-1}T-t^{\frac{\alpha+\beta}{\alpha}- \frac{1}{\alpha_j}- \frac{1}{\alpha}}\\\le \, C\Vert g \Vert_{C^{\alpha+\beta}_{b,d}}\vert (\bm{x}-\bm{x}')_1 \vertT-t^{\frac{\alpha+\beta-2}{\alpha}} \, \le \,Cc^{\frac{\alpha+\beta-2}{\alpha}}_0\Vert g\Vert_{C^{\alpha+\beta}_{b,d}}d^{\alpha + \beta-1}(\bm{x},\bm{x}')\end{gathered}$$ where in the last passage we used that $\vert(\bm{x}-\bm{x}')_1\vert=d(\bm{x},\bm{x}')$ and, since $\frac{\alpha+\beta-2}{\alpha}<0$, that $$\vert(\bm{x}-\bm{x}')_1\vert T-t^{\frac{\alpha+\beta-2}{\alpha}} \, \le \, c^{\frac{\alpha+\beta-2}{\alpha}}_0d^{\alpha +\beta-1}(\bm{x},\bm{x}').$$ Remembering that $c_0$ is considered fixed and bigger then zero, the searched control follows immediately.
s-t	smallsetminus j} \\\le \,	It then follows that $$\begin{gathered}\int_{0}^{s-t^{\delta_j}}v^{\frac{\alpha_j+\beta_j}{\alpha}}\int_{\R^d} J_{2,2}(v,z,\bm{y}_{\smallsetminus j}) \, dz dv \\\le \, s-t^{\delta_j\frac{\alpha_j+\beta_j}{\alpha}}\int_{\R^d}\vert D_{\bm{y}_j}D^\vartheta_{\bm{x}} \tilde{p}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}(t,s,\bm{x},\bm{y}) \vert d^{1+\alpha(j-2)+\beta}_{j:n} (y, \bm{\theta}_{\tau,s}(\bm{\xi})) d\bm{y}_j.\end{gathered}$$ Taking now $\tau=t$ and $\bm{\xi}=\bm{x}$, we conclude with $J_{2,2}$ applying the partial smoothing effect of $\tilde{p}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}$ under the hypothesis $1+\alpha(j-2)+\beta \le \alpha(1+\alpha(j-1))$ (see Equation ) to write that $$\begin{gathered}\label{Proof:Second_Besov_Control_J'2}\int_{\R^{(n-1)d}}\int_{0}^{s-t^{\delta_j}}v^{\frac{\alpha_j+\beta_j}{\alpha}}\int_{\R^d} J_{2,2}(v,z,\bm{y}_{\smallsetminus j}) \, dz \,dv d\bm{y}_{\ s-t^{\delta_j\frac{\alpha_j+\beta_j}{\alpha}}\int_{\R^{nd}}\vert D_{\bm{y}_j}D^\vartheta_{\bm{x}} \tilde{p}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}(t,s,\bm{x},\bm{y}) \vert d^{1+\alpha(j-2)+\beta}_{j:n} (y, \bm{\theta}_{\tau,s}(\bm{\xi})) d\bm{y} \\\le \, Cs-t^{\delta_j\frac{\alpha_j+\beta_j}{\alpha}+\frac{1+\alpha(j-2)+\beta}{\alpha}- \frac{1}{\alpha_j}-\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\vartheta_k}{\alpha_k}}.\end{gathered}$$ Looking back to Equations , , and , we can finally choose the right $\delta_j$.
s,\bm{x}	s}R^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}	Then, any classical solution $u$ in $L^\infty(0,T;C^{\alpha+\beta}_{b,d}(\R^{nd}))$ of Equation can be represented for any $(t,\bm{x})$ in $[0,T]\times\R^{nd}$ as $$\begin{gathered}\label{eq:Change_of_Freez_point_HOlder}u(t,\bm{x}) \, = \, \tilde{P}^{\tau,\tilde{\bm{\xi}}}_{t,T}g(\bm{x}) + \tilde{G}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}_{t,t_0}f(t,\bm{x}) +\tilde{G}^{\tau,\tilde{\bm{\xi}}}_{t_0,T}f(t,\bm{x}) \\+ \int_{t}^{t_0} \tilde{P}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}_{t, s,\bm{x}\, ds +\int_{t_0}^{T} \tilde{P}^{\tau,\tilde{\bm{\xi}}}_{t,s}R^{\tau,\tilde{\bm{\xi}}}s,\bm{x}\, ds + \tilde{P}^{\tau,\bm{\xi}}_{t,t_0}u(t_0,\bm{x}) -\tilde{P}^{\tau,\tilde{\bm{\xi}}}_{t,t_0}u(t_0,\bm{x})\end{gathered}$$ where $t_0$ is the change of regime time defined in .Fixed $t$ in $(0,T)$, we start considering another point $r$ in $(t,T)$.

ISP	Internet Service Provider	A BRAS is a device that terminates remote users at the corporate network or Internet users at the ISP network, and commonly provides firewall, authentication, and routing services for remote users.
BBNG	Broadband Network Gateway	Next generation BRAS devices are frequently referred to as BBNG devices.The ATM protocol is an international standard in which multiple service types (such as voice, video, or data) are conveyed in fixed-length “cells” over point-to-point network connections.

FIFO	first-in-first-out	Shaping may be applied to the output of a single FIFO queue, or may be applied to a number of queues using an IP queuing scheme where traffic is classified into queues based on context information in the IP header, such as the source or destination address.
CBWFQ	class-based weighted fair queueing	These queues may then be serviced using a queuing algorithm such as a CBWFQ, for example.A primary reason for using traffic shaping is to regulate traffic in order to avoid congestion that can occur when the sent traffic exceeds the access speed of its remote, target interface.
L2	Layer 2	However, in the case of DSL and FTTH, often times the next L2 hop is a DSLAM that lacks the ability to perform IP QoS functions.
DHCP	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol	For example, many DSLAMs are unable to perform Class-Based Queuing (CPQ) based on widely used protocols such as the DHCP or the IEEE 802.1P specification, which enables Layer 2 switches to prioritize traffic and perform dynamic multicast filtering.
MAC	media access control	(The 802.1P specification works at the MAC framing layer, and includes a three-bit header field for prioritization, which allows packets to be grouped into various traffic classes.)
GE	Gigabit Ethernet	This type of shaping may be used in conjunction with IP queuing.One problem with this approach, however, is that for IP sessions in GE DSLAM aggregation networks, there is no L2 identifier such as the VPI/VCI at the BRAS upon which to shape all of the traffic to a particular subscriber line.
VLAN	virtual local area network	In many cases, the VPI/VCI concept is replaced at L2 with a VLAN that is shared among multiple subscribers.
IAT	image analysis technology	Tissue pieces of the heart, liver, spleen and kidney of one corpse (male, 54 years old, died of mechanical injury, PMI of 6h) were obtained in 6, 12, 24, 48 h after death, fixed in Carnoy fluid, and then paraffin sections were prepared, stained with Feulgen and analyzed by IAT.

95 Votes	98% (4637 Votes) 2%	 95 Votes“The truth has cost LTC Alexander Vindman his job, his career, and his privacy.”The ouster comes after Vindman testified against Trump during the failed attempt to remove the executive from office.The lieutenant colonel infamously bypassed his chain of command to voice concerns about the president, a major breach of military ethics and conduct.Vindman claimed the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the center of the impeachment was improper, a testimony that furthered Democrats’ narrative.Ultimately, Trump was acquitted of all charges levied against him during a trial in the Senate.RELATED: Biden Lays Groundwork for Election Doubt with Wild Claim About Trump Trying To 'Steal' ElectionThe Ukraine expert claimed his involvement in Democrats’ impeachment of the president made him a target.Despite the supposed threats to his life, Vindman was still seen smiling, laughing and taking selfies in public.Vindman will now likely return to the Pentagon to await a future reassignment.One thing’s for certain: He won’t be listening in on any presidential phone calls in the future.We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

AKI	acute kidney injury	 AKI is a frequent complication of circulatory failure and associated with increased morbidity and mortality \[[@CR1], [@CR2]\].
MAP	mean arterial pressure	Although fluids are often given to patients with AKI with the aim of increasing renal perfusion, physicians generally evaluate the effectiveness of fluid therapy by looking at systemic hemodynamic variables, such as MAP or cardiac output, because the increase in urine output may be delayed or inconsistent and the decrease in serum creatinine may be even slower.
ILA	interlobar artery	A direct evaluation of renal hemodynamics would be valuable, but is not easily obtained at the bedside.Recently, ILA resistivity index (RI), a reliable surrogate of intrarenal vascular tone measured by renal Doppler (RIAD), has been proposed for bedside evaluation of intrarenal hemodynamics in critically ill patients \[[@CR7]--[@CR9]\].

ECM	extracellular matrix	Introduction {#s1}============Hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis is a chronic scarring process of the liver that is associated with increased and altered deposition of ECM.
HSCs	hepatic stellate cells	During the chronic liver injury, HSCs undergo a process of transdifferentiation from a resting, fat-storing phenotype to a myofibroblast-like phenotype characterized by expression of fibroblastic cell markers such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA).
α-SMA	α-smooth muscle actin	During the chronic liver injury, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) undergo a process of transdifferentiation from a resting, fat-storing phenotype to a myofibroblast-like phenotype characterized by expression of fibroblastic cell markers such as α-SMA.
NR	nuclear receptor	The regulation of HSC activation during the chronic liver injury is not completely understood, however, a number of studies have suggested that members of the NR superfamily negatively regulate HSC transdifferentiation [@pone.0013955-Galli1], [@pone.0013955-Haughton1], [@pone.0013955-She1].The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) belongs to the superfamily of ligand-activated transcriptional factors.
FXR	farnesoid X receptor	The regulation of HSC activation during the chronic liver injury is not completely understood, however, a number of studies have suggested that members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily negatively regulate HSC transdifferentiation [@pone.0013955-Galli1], [@pone.0013955-Haughton1], [@pone.0013955-She1].The FXR belongs to the superfamily of ligand-activated transcriptional factors.
BA	bile acid	FXR has the typical nuclear receptor structure and can be activated by structurally different ligands, including several primary and secondary BA species conjugated to either taurine or glycine [@pone.0013955-Parks1].
MLC	myosin light chain	](pone.0013955.g006){#pone-0013955-g006}One of the major consequences of activation of RhoA/Rho kinase pathway is the phosphorylation of MLC, which is critically involved in the contraction of HSCs.
EMSA	electrophoretic mobility shift assay	Functional promoter assays including EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay suggest that FXR inhibits ET-1 expression via interference with NF-κB/AP-1 signaling [@pone.0013955-He1].
ChIP	chromatin immunoprecipitation	Functional promoter assays including electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and ChIP assay suggest that FXR inhibits ET-1 expression via interference with NF-κB/AP-1 signaling [@pone.0013955-He1].
ERM	ezrin-radixin-moesin	Nonetheless, the impaired activation of RhoA clearly resulted in a reduced activity of Rho-kinase, as shown by reduced phosphorylation of moesin, a member of the family of ERM proteins, which is phosphorylated at Thr-558 by Rho-kinase.The inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase signaling is clearly implicated in the GW4064-mediated inhibition of stellate cell contraction as the phosphorylation of the downstream MLC is significantly decreased.

SCRI	signaling connection release indication	We estimate ineffective power consumed during the time according to the minimum current consumption value of each state in background knowledge, which is 150 mA*20 sec+100 mA*20 sec=5000 mA*sec and is equivalent to power consumed for 1.5 hours in the low-power-consumption idle state, and this power can satisfy the demand that one terminal is continuously in a standby state for 1.5 hours.Also as specified in 3GPP protocols, the wireless data terminal may transmit a SCRI message to a network side, the network side may release physical channel resources after receiving the message, and the RRC module of the terminal does not maintain the RRC connection any longer but enters a low-power-consumption mode.To select what time to enable the terminal to initiate SCRI signaling is simply referred to as “SCM policy” in this present document.

WM	working memory	Introduction {#s1}============Various mechanisms have been proposed to model the main aspect of neural activity --- elevated firing rates of a cue-specific population of neurons --- observed during the delay period of a WM task [@pcbi.1000879-Fuster1]--[@pcbi.1000879-Baddeley2].
PNGs	polychronous neuronal groups	In [Figure 1](#pcbi-1000879-g001){ref-type="fig"}, we use a small network to illustrate this concept: Two distinct patterns of synaptic connections (red and black connections in [Figure 1A--1C](#pcbi-1000879-g001){ref-type="fig"}) with appropriate axonal conduction delays form two distinct * PNGs.
STDP	spike-timing dependent plasticity [@pcbi.1000879-Markram1]	PNGs arise spontaneously [@pcbi.1000879-Izhikevich1], [@pcbi.1000879-Izhikevich2] in simulated realistic cortical spiking networks shaped by STDP.!
EPSPs	excitatory postsynaptic potentials	The latter mechanism is also pre- and postsynaptic activity dependent: Pre-synaptic spikes alone activate postsynaptic NMDA receptors, yet only generate small EPSPs at the dendritic compartment ([Figure 2D](#pcbi-1000879-g002){ref-type="fig"}, red trace) because of the magnesium block of the NMDA receptors.

CV	coefficient of variation	The CV of inter-spike intervals (ISIs), i.e., the variability of ISIs (see [Methods](#s4){ref-type="sec"}), is higher for individual intra-PNG neurons when the PNG is in WM [@pcbi.1000879-Compte1] ([Figure 4C](#pcbi-1000879-g004){ref-type="fig"} and [Figure S6](#pcbi.1000879.s006){ref-type="supplementary-material"}).
ISIs	inter-spike intervals	The coefficient of variation (CV) of ISIs, i.e., the variability of ISIs (see [Methods](#s4){ref-type="sec"}), is higher for individual intra-PNG neurons when the PNG is in WM [@pcbi.1000879-Compte1] ([Figure 4C](#pcbi-1000879-g004){ref-type="fig"} and [Figure S6](#pcbi.1000879.s006){ref-type="supplementary-material"}).
CCG	cross-correlogram	 CCG of simulated intra-PNG neuronal pairs also reveal the precisely timed nature of their spiking activity, as well as the context-dependent changes in functional connectivity linking these neurons: The red CCG in [Figure 4D](#pcbi-1000879-g004){ref-type="fig"} is recorded while the target PNG is in WM, and it has a peak around 5 ms, whereas the blue CCG (recorded later in a different session, when the PNG is not activated) is flat.
tPNG	target PNG	The first, red tPNG is activated at time 0 seconds; the second, black tPNG at time 5 seconds.
CV	coefficient of variation	The CV measures the variation in the neurons\' ISIs: , i.e., CV equals the standard deviation of ISIs divided by the mean ISI.

NCID	National Centre for Infectious Diseases	SINGAPORE - Several of the locally infected patients with no known links had seen a doctor two or three times before they were sent to hospital.This is because the illness generally starts mild with non-specific symptoms such as cough, sore throat, slight fever and feeling tired, said Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the NCID.These are symptoms tens of thousands of people suffer from every day in Singapore alone, she added.So it is difficult to identify those infected by the novel coronavirus if they have no links to China or to other patients.She said they may be mildly sick for more than a week before the virus affects their lungs.That is why those who feel unwell are advised to stay home, or if they need to go out, to wear a mask so they do not spread disease to others.Professor Tan Chorh Chuan, chief health scientist at the Ministry of Health (MOH), said: "In today's environment, be prudent.

MCMC	Markov chain Monte Carlo	Our methods are illustrated using simulated and real-world examples, including an application to cancer mortality surveillance.\ [Keywords: CAR model; Gaussian graphical model; G-Wishart distribution; Lattice data; MCMC simulation; Spatial statistics.
GGMs	Gaussian graphical models	In addition, the G-Wishart naturally accommodates decomposable and non-decomposable graphs in a coherent manner.\Many recent papers have described various stochastic search methods in GGMs with the G-Wishart prior based on marginal likelihoods which, in this case, are given by the ratio of the normalizing constants of the posterior and prior G-Wishart distributions – see @atay-kayis_massam_2005 [@jones_et_2005; @carvalho_scott_2009; @lenkoski-dobra-2010] and the references therein.
CAR	conditional autoregressive model	Second, we devise a new flexible class of CAR [@Be74] for lattice data that rely on our novel sampling algorithms.
i,j	i<j\mbox{ and }	The zero constraints on the off-diagonal elements of ${\mathbf{K}}$ associated with $G$ induce well-defined sets of free elements ${\mathbf{\Phi}}^{\nu(G)}=\{\Phi_{ij}:i,j\in \nu(G)\}$ and ${\mathbf{\Psi}}^{\nu(G)}=\{\Psi_{ij}:i,j\in \nu(G)\}$ of the matrices ${\mathbf{\Phi}}$ and ${\mathbf{\Psi}}$ [@roverato_2002; @atay-kayis_massam_2005], where $$\nu(G) = \{ (i,i):i\in V_{p}\}\cup \{i,j: i,j\in E\}.$$ We denote by $M^{\nu(G)}$ the set of incomplete triangular matrices whose elements are indexed by $\nu(G)$ and whose diagonal elements are strictly positive.

FCC	Federal Communications Commission	Cherry & Webb sold WPRO-AM-FM-TV to Albany, New York-based Capital Cities Television Corporation, the predecessor of Capital Cities Communications, in 1959, earning a handsome return on its purchase of WPRO radio in 1931.WPRI (1967–present)WPRO-TV was then sold to Poole Broadcasting (owners of WJRT-TV in Flint, Michigan) on June 16, 1967; that sale was necessary because CapCities' purchase of KTRK-TV in Houston left it one VHF station over the FCC ownership limit at the time.
LMA	local marketing agreement	Most of the Web sites of the television stations Media General acquired since the announced merger with Young Broadcasting have also adopted this platform.LMA with WNAC-TV (1997–present)Shortly after Clear Channel took over the station, WPRI entered in a LMA with Fox affiliate WNAC (then owned by Argyle Television).
FCC	Federal Communications Commission	LIN TV continued to operate WNAC under the same LMA it inherited from Sunrise.WPRI-TV received FCC consent to discontinue regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 12, on February 17, 2009, the original date when full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009).

BS	base station	We propose a four step algorithm that optimizes the ADC resolution profile at the BS to reduce the energy consumption and perform joint power control and resource allocation of D2D communication users (DUEs) and cellular users (CUEs) to improve the D2D reliability.
DUEs	D2D communication users	We propose a four step algorithm that optimizes the ADC resolution profile at the base station (BS) to reduce the energy consumption and perform joint power control and resource allocation of DUEs and cellular users (CUEs) to improve the D2D reliability.
CUEs	cellular users	We propose a four step algorithm that optimizes the ADC resolution profile at the base station (BS) to reduce the energy consumption and perform joint power control and resource allocation of D2D communication users (DUEs) and CUEs to improve the D2D reliability.
CUES	cellular users	In the D2D underlay mode, the regular CUES use dedicated resource blocks, and the D2D communication users (DUEs) share spectrum resources with the CUEs.
DUEs	D2D communication users	In the D2D underlay mode, the regular cellular users (CUES) use dedicated resource blocks, and the DUEs share spectrum resources with the CUEs.
QoS	quality of service	Motivated by environmental concerns and economic factors, green communication strategies in which the energy consumption at the BS is minimized while satisfying the QoS requirements of the end users has gained significant traction [@bai2015ee].Using low-cost and power-efficient low-resolution ADCs, at the cost of signal quality and quantization noise is one way to minimize BS energy consumption [@jacobsson2017throughput; @fan2015uplink; @ding2018outage; @xu2019uplink; @srinivasan2019analysis].
i.i.d.	identically and independently	However, the statistical nature and the slow fading parameters of the DUEs are available at the BS.The channel coefficients from the $m$th CUE to the BS is ${\mathbf{g}}_{m,B} = [g_{m,B}^1,..., g_{m,B}^{N_R}]^T$, where the $i$th element is $g_{m,B}^i = \sqrt{\alpha_{m,B}}h_{m,B}^i, \: i=1,..,N_R.$ Here, $h_{m,B}^i \sim CN(0,1) $, the small-scale fading component, is i.i.d.
SINR	signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio	Typically, the energy consumption at the BS has to be optimized such that it is below a threshold.Outage probability at DUE-------------------------The SINR at the $k$th DUE Rx is $$\begin{aligned} \gamma_k^d= \frac{P_k^d |{g}_{k}|^2}{\sigma^2+\underset{m \in \mathcal{M}}{\sum}\rho_{m,k} P_m^c |{g}_{m,k}|^2 + \sum\limits_{k'\ne k}\rho_{m,k'} P_{k'}^d |g_{k',k}|^2 },\end{aligned}$$ where $\sigma^2$ is the noise power, $P_m^c$ and $P^d_k$ denote transmit powers of the $m$th CUE and the $k$th DUE Tx, respectively.
MRC	maximum ratio combining	After MRC, the received signal $r$ is given by $${\mathbf{r}} = {\mathbf{g}}_{m,B}^H {\mathbf{y}}_q.$$ Hence, the interference and noise power affecting the $m^{th}$ CUE signal at the BS is given by, $$\begin{aligned} \nonumber I_m &= \sum\limits_{k \in \mathcal{K}}\rho_{m,k}P_{k}^d|{\mathbf{g}}_{m,B}^H {\mathbf{A}}_b{\mathbf{g}}_{k,B}|^2+\sigma^2||{\mathbf{g}}_{m,B}^H {\mathbf{A}}_b||^2 \\ &+ {\mathbf{g}}_{m,B}^H {\mathbf{R}}_{n_q, n_q}{\mathbf{g}}_{m,B},\end{aligned}$$ where ${\mathbf{R_{n_q n_q}}}$ is the covariance of ${\mathbf{n}}_q$ and is given by [@fan2015uplink Eq.
SIQNR	signal-to-interference-quantization noise ratio	Therefore, the instantaneous SIQNR at the $m$th CUE is $$\begin{aligned} \gamma_m^c= \frac{P_m^c|{\mathbf{g}}_{m,B}^H {\mathbf{A}}_b{\mathbf{g}}_{m,B}|^2}{I_m}\end{aligned}$$ It is intractable to determine the exact ergodic rate $R_m^c=\mathbb{E} \left\lbrace \text{log}_2(1+\gamma_m^c) \right\rbrace$ due to the presence of the quantization noise term [@fan2015uplink; @srinivasan2019analysis; @ding2018outage].

NFL	National Football League	Ray Saul was re-elected as public relations director and secretary.EPBL president Harry Rudolph announced plans to file a $1,000,000 defamation of character lawsuit against NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle for saying, "several players in the Eastern Basketball [League] were accused of gambling on games involving teams for which they formerly played."
NBA	National Basketball Association	The proposal was ultimately rejected.The league postponed its collegiate draft due to the 1961 NCAA University Division men's basketball gambling scandal.Rules were adopted before the 1961–62 season to mirror the rules of the NBA.The Allentown Jets announced they had signed Andrew "Fuzzy" Levane to a one-year contract as coach in September 1961.In October 1961, the EPBL passed a resolution that would give a lifetime ban to any player who left an EPBL team for another league.
ABL	American Basketball League	The rule came in response to players who left the league the fledgling ABL.In December 1961, a "State Basketball Championship" for Pennsylvania was proposed by Pittsburgh Rens owner Lenny Litman between his ABL team, the NBA Philadelphia Warriors and the EPBL Sunbury Mercuries.EPBL president Harry Rudolph announced that the Camden franchise had been fined $150 for failing to have the required seven players in uniform for a game on January 27, 1962 in which Camden lost to Williamsport 153–126.
ABL	American Basketball League	The Carbondale franchise was admitted to the league, but that deal was eventually voided when team owners failed to meet their financial obligations according to league president Harry Rudolph.In November 1962, after the ABL folded, EPBL president Harry Rudolph announced that players who were banned for leaving their EPBL teams for the ABL could apply for re-admittance to the league if they wrote a letter to the league president with $25 as payment for a fine.

STD	short-term disability leave	This incident triggered the following events, which culminated in Plaintiff's termination: On June 18, 1992, through her physician, Plaintiff requested STD, which GTE granted.
LTD	long-term disability	While on STD, Plaintiff applied for disability benefits with the Social Security Administration and for LTD benefits under a disability policy that she had purchased from The Travelers insurance company.
TCHRA	Texas Commission on Human Rights Act	Plaintiff alleges that GTE should have treated her as an employee on indefinite leave returning to work for reassignment.SUMMARY OF CLAIMS AND DEFENSESPlaintiff raises three causes of action in her complaint: (1) violation of the ADA, (2) violation of the TCHRA, and (3) breach of contract.
FMLA	Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993	Second, Defendant contends that the ("FMLA") manifests Congress' intent that the ADA not require indefinite leave in that the FMLA provisions, which under the rules of statutory construction are to be construed consistently with the ADA, require only twelve workweeks of unpaid leave.
ADA	Americans with Disabilities Act	Pre-Effective Date ConductThe ADA was enacted on July 26, 1990.
EEOC	Employment Opportunity Commission	Post-Effective Date ConductIn order to properly sue an employer under the ADA, a plaintiff must first file a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal EEOC and receive a Right to Sue Letter.
TCHRA	Texas Commission on Human Rights Act	The As the parties have correctly agreed, the majority of courts construing the TCHRA have relied almost exclusively on federal authorities.

ILSs	indoor localization systems	Introduction {#sec1-sensors-16-00876}===============Emerging wireless technologies increase the potential and effectiveness of wireless ILSs.
RTLSs	real-time location systems	Hence, recently, RTLSs, an example of ILS, have gained increasing attention, mostly in the industrial sector, due to their capabilities and performance.
RSS	received signal strength	Besides that, RTLSs are widely applied in assets by tracking management systems in warehouses \[[@B5-sensors-16-00876]\], container terminals \[[@B6-sensors-16-00876]\], and hospitals \[[@B3-sensors-16-00876]\].Due to the radio wave propagation phenomena caused by environment structures and movements in indoor spaces, many wireless technologies based on RSS have, in practice, unreliable measurement methods.
ToA	time of arrival	The ToA method requires a highly accurate system clock and a precise synchronization module, which increase the system's cost significantly.
AoA	angle of arrival	Therefore, AoA-based RTLSs seem to be a reliable and cost-friendly solution.The fingerprinting technique is a pattern-based indoor localization technique useful for characterizing an indoor environment.
UWB	ultra-wideband	They are able to localize a target in indoor spaces with relatively high accuracy, up to 15 cm for typical UWB-based ILS.
NLoS	non-line-of-sight	The hybrid algorithm is designed for NLoS environments.
WSNs	wireless sensor networks	Moreover, the authors apply a statistical calibration method to improve the localization quality.AoA-based localization techniques are also applicable in WSNs.
DoP	Dilution of Precision	Therefore, the DoP, the concept originally used in satellite navigation systems, is derived for AoA-based positioning systems to characterize the positioning quality \[[@B14-sensors-16-00876]\].
LoS	line-of-sight	The evolutionary algorithm is used to choose optimal LoS measurement positions.
AoP	angles of precision	Then, the probability of the single standard deviation of the mean is 68.3%, the angles $\alpha_{Ai}$ and $\alpha_{Bi}$ are within the ranges $\alpha_{Ai} \in \left( {\overline{\alpha_{A}} - \sigma_{A},\ \overline{\alpha_{A}} + \sigma_{A}} \right)$ and $\alpha_{Bi} \in \left( {\overline{\alpha_{B}} - \sigma_{B},\ \overline{\alpha_{B}} + \sigma_{B}} \right)$, which define the AoP.
GDoP	geometric dilution of precision	Then the uncertainty of AoA ranging technique can be estimated in terms of: Surface area of the tetragon, which can be calculated using the Shoelace formula \[[@B24-sensors-16-00876]\],Lengths $d_{x}$ and $d_{y}$ ([Figure 4](#sensors-16-00876-f004){ref-type="fig"}) corresponding to maximum uncertainty of$\ x$ and $y$ components, respectively.The surface area of the tetragon as an estimated uncertainty is the angular measure of precision analogically to GDoP, which is a measure of positional measurement precision used in satellite navigation.The uncertainty of the AoA ranging technique can be described by the angular precision non-exclusively assuming the same distribution in the whole workspace.
TDoA	time difference of arrival	The RTLS operates in AoA, TDoA, and RSS physical measurements, however, just AoA raw measurements without filtration are analyzed.6.1.

Cofetel	Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones	Los papeles de la telefónica retrocedieron a 3.03 pesos hacia las 11:06 horas de este martes, e incluso descendieron hasta 13.90% (2.92 pesos) al inicio de las operaciones en la plaza mexicana.Este lunes, el máximo tribunal validó el cobro de la externalidad, al considerar que la Cofetel tiene la facultad para permitir este cobro entre operadores de telefonía.La medida beneficia a Telcel porque el curso de llamadas de líneas fijas a móviles es mayor, y por tanto son las empresas como Axtel quienes más deben pagar en montos por interconexión.Los ministros aún deben definir cuestiones importantes sobre las tarifas de interconexión para el caso del juicio de amparo en revisión 426/2010, y determinar así los efectos que tendrá sobre Axtel y Telcel.La resolución que tome la SCJN sobre ese amparo dará la pauta para resolver otros juicios que atrajo el máximo tribunal.Fitch cifró en junio pasado en más de 3,000 millones de pesos los montos que deberá compensar Axtel a Telcel y Telmex, en caso de perder estos casos en tribunales.PublicidadLos operadores de telefonía, tanto móvil como fija, se cobran las tarifas de interconexión cada vez que una llamada de un usuario cursa por la red de Telcel para llegar a uno de sus clientes, por lo que la primera empresa debe pagar a la segunda (bajo el concepto de 'El que llama paga').En un mensaje enviado a la BMV, Axtel dijo que dada la relevancia del tema y el estado en que se encuentra, esperará a que la SCJN concluya el proceso y emita una sentencia, tras lo cual estará en posibilidades de emitir un comunicado al respecto.

EPH	ephrin receptor	But the importance of cell-cell interactions and secreted, extracellular molecules in reprogramming has not been extensively studied.To approach this problem, we focused on EPH/EPHRIN (EFN) signaling pathways.
MEFs	mouse embryonic fibroblasts	However, whether EPH/EPHRIN signaling pathways regulate cell reprogramming has been unknown.In this study, we found that EPHA7, among EPH and EFN members, is most prominently upregulated during reprogramming and that secreted, truncated EPHA7 plays a crucial role in reprogramming through inducing ERK activity reduction.Results {#sec2}=======EPHA7 Is Prominently Upregulated during Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast Reprogramming {#sec2.1}--------------------------------------------------------------------------------We measured the changes in the expression levels of *Eph*- and *Efn*-family genes during OSKM-induced reprogramming of MEFs and found that *EphA7* shows the most prominent upregulation.
shRNA	small hairpin RNA	*EphA7* mRNA levels were markedly reduced by each *EphA7* shRNA ([Figure 2](#fig2){ref-type="fig"}A).
pERK1/2	phosphorylated ERK1/2	Because there are many other ligands for EPHA7, knockdown of *EfnA3* may not produce a large effect.Truncated EPHA7 Promotes Cell Reprogramming by Inducing ERK Activity Reduction {#sec2.3}------------------------------------------------------------------------------It has previously been shown that secreted, truncated EPHA7 inhibits EPH signaling, which induces the phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 in lymphomas ([@bib15]), and that the levels of pERK1/2 are increased when mouse ESCs lose pluripotency and start to differentiate ([@bib9]).

Y en los robots se suma la forma antropomórfica, que lo hace más fácil”, apunta el especialista en filosofía de la ciencia y la computación Jordi Vallverdú, que investiga sobre emociones sintéticas.“Con las máquinas construimos nuestra intimidad y desarrollamos afectividad; basta ver cómo hay gente que se estresa más si tiene un problema con su ordenador o con el móvil que si discute con alguien porque su identidad está construida con eso; y un robot que te atiende, que trabaja y está contigo, que te permite interactuar, que te da soporte intelectual al compartir información contigo se convierte en un álter ego; puede que en el futuro uno cambie de casa, de pareja, de trabajo o de amigos y lo único estable que tenga sea su robot”, explica Antonio López Peláez, profesor de la UNED, especialista en la interrelación entre tecnologías y trabajo social y editor de The Robotics Divide (la brecha robótica).Los guionistas de cine han fantaseado bastante sobre el apego que establecerán los humanos con los robots con lo que convivan (véase la información de apoyo).

NET	neutrophil extracellular trap	Among the e-cigarette-using group, a clear upsurge in neutrophil granulocyte- and NET-related proteins was recorded.The study found that as neutrophils are important in fighting pathogens, they also are well-known to add to lung infections and conditions like COPD and cystic fibrosis.The study also found same increases in particular biomarkers in connection with lung disease among e-cigarette and cigarette smokers.A rise in mucin 5AC, a mucus secretion linked to chronic bronchitis and asthma, was also discovered in both e-cigarette and cigarette smokers.It is critical to note that this experiment wasn’t large and limited, the authors stating the fact that many of the e-cigarette group were ex-cigarette users which makes it uneasy to apparently establish if these outcome were only associated to e-cigarette use.The main rationale to consider here though is that a lot of past studies have largely tested the harm of e-cigarettes in association to the fatal attribute of cigarettes, potentially ignoring the special or novel methods e-cigarettes may cause harm.“You comparing the damage of e-cigarettes with cigarettes is a more like comparing apples to oranges,” says Dr. Mehmet Kesimer, senior author of the current experiment.

IUCN	International Union for Conservation of Nature	Overfishing, hunting and land development have pushed more species closer to extinction, according to a new report.The Red List report by the IUCN found that 27% of the more than 105,000 species the organization has analyzed are at risk of extinction, a total of 28,338 different species.IUCN also found that no species on its list have shown any sign of improvement since it was last updated in December 2018.“Things are not getting better, they are getting worse,” Craig Hilton-Taylor, head of the IUCN Red List unit, tells TIME.The Red List places the 105,732 species of plants and animals that it analyses into different categories: the number of species that are considered threatened fall into the categories of vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered.
IPBES	Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services	Even deep-sea species are at risk because of deep-fishing and the oil and gas industries, according to IUCN.The Red List update comes about two months after a grim report from the IPBES found that 1 million species of plants and animals are now threatened with extinction.“This Red List update confirms the findings of the recent IPBES Global Biodiversity Assessment: nature is declining at rates unprecedented in human history,” said Jane Smart, Global Director of the IUCN Biodiversity Conservation Group, in a public statement.

ALM	Avid Life Media	Have an affair.” It’s since been changed to “Find your moment”.The service marketed as the discreet way to cheat suddenly lost its trump card — privacy.A joint investigation by Canada and Australia’s Privacy Commissioners found Ashley Madison’s parent company ALM “did not have appropriate safeguards in place considering the sensitivity of the personal information ... nor did it take reasonable steps in the circumstances to protect the personal information it held.”ALM, now rebranded as Ruby Corp, were given a deadline, which ends today, to obtain independent third party assurance that it had adopted the report’s recommendations and secured its members’ data.Ruby Corp hired Ontario’s former Information and Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian to overhaul its privacy and data policies.“We have received our Privacy by Design certification, which is an important certification,” Mr Keable told news.com.au by phone from Toronto, where Ashley Madison’s main office is based.“We have put privacy of our members’ data at the heart of our business and we now look at data as something that is sacred to us,” Mr Keable said.“Our members are trusting us with something that is incredibly important.
GPCRs	G protein-coupled receptors	Introduction {#s1}============Extracellular signaling molecules such as neurotransmitters and hormones transmit their signals into cells by interacting with the large family (\>900) of cell surface GPCRs and linked heterotrimeric (Gαβγ subunits) GTP binding proteins (G proteins).
G proteins	GTP-binding proteins	Introduction {#s1}============Extracellular signaling molecules such as neurotransmitters and hormones transmit their signals into cells by interacting with the large family (\>900) of cell surface G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and linked heterotrimeric (Gαβγ subunits) G proteins.
GAPs	GTPase-activating proteins	However, Gα GTPase activity is regulated and greatly accelerated by cofactor GAPs.The most prominent GAPs for Gα subunits include the family (∼40 members) of regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins, which bind to Gα-GTP and increase GTP hydrolysis [@pone.0095355-He1]--[@pone.0095355-Hollinger1].
RGS	regulator of G protein signaling	However, Gα GTPase activity is regulated and greatly accelerated by cofactor GTPase activating proteins (GAPs).The most prominent GAPs for Gα subunits include the family (∼40 members) of RGS proteins, which bind to Gα-GTP and increase GTP hydrolysis [@pone.0095355-He1]--[@pone.0095355-Hollinger1].
PARs	protease-activated receptors	These interactions are regulated by specific regions with the N-termini of the RGS proteins and the i3 loops of the GPCRs [@pone.0095355-Bernstein1], [@pone.0095355-Hague1]. PARs are GPCRs that can be activated by proteases such as thrombin, trypsin and plasmin.

NOPR	Notice of Proposed Rulemaking	“That word ‘resilience’ that was used on the DOE side is just not the same [as what we're doing].”The DOE’s NOPR, filed last September, would have provided cost recovery to merchant power plants that keep 90 days of fuel supply onsite, largely benefiting coal and nuclear generators.
LMP	locational marginal price	In a Tuesday interview with Utility Dive, he offered new insights into PJM’s plans for energy and capacity market changes, as well as its upcoming resilience filing.Energy market reformOf PJM’s proposed market reforms, changes to its energy market have attracted the most scrutiny for bailout concerns.Floated in a staff white paper last November, PJM’s plan would alter market rules to allow large, inflexible units to set the LMP that forms the foundation of the day-ahead and real-time energy markets.Currently, the next resource that can respond to a price signal is allowed to set the LMP — typically gas plants that can vary their output.
MOPR	Minimum Offer Price Rule	PJM would recalculate prices after the first round by removing offers from subsidized resources and replacing them with reference prices, reflecting PJM’s estimates of a competitive offer.PJMAn alternative plan from PJM’s Independent Market Monitor would expand the current MOPR to cover subsidized resources, preventing them from bidding in at price levels below a certain point.Ott argued the two proposals represent different schools of thought on how to handle state energy policies.

UNDOF	UN Disengagement Observer Force	They are well-disciplined warrior peacekeepers,” Ancan said.Syrian rebels, including fighters from the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, stormed a Golan Heights crossing on Wednesday, sparking an exchange of gunfire with Israeli troops.The rebels then captured 43 Fijian members of the UNDOF on the Syrian side on Thursday, forcing them to surrender their weapons and taking them hostage.Ancan said the rebels then used an English-speaking Fijian hostage to relay their demand to the Filipino peacekeepers to give up their weapons, but they refused.Meanwhile, talks were under way to release the Fijian hostages, said Fijian Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama, who said they were believed to be safe.“I want to assure the families of the soldiers we are doing everything possible to secure their safe return,” Bainimarama said in a statement “The latest information we have is that they are safe and I can say now that the negotiations for their release have already begun.”The UN Security Council demanded the “unconditional and immediate release of all the detained United Nations peacekeepers” and urged countries with influence to help win their release.Manila called for the “immediate release” of the Fijian troops and the “immediate withdrawal of all non-UN forces around UNDOF positions,” Philippine foreign affairs spokesman Charles Jose told reporters.“It likewise calls on the UN to exert every effort to ensure the safety and security of all peacekeepers of UNDOF,” he said.

SEPs	stellar energetic particles	For a planet that does not have atmospheric constituents (*e.g.,* O~2~, O~3~, CO~2~) to absorb this short-wavelength radiation, the surface could be regularly irradiated.The second impactful aspect of flare events involves SEPs that can be accelerated during the impulsive phase of flares.
AD Leo	AD Leonis	* ([@B67]) performed the first study to explore the effect of a single, high-energy flare (and associated SEPs) on the atmospheric chemistry of a habitable planet; their study investigated the impact of an event equivalent to the 1985 April 12 flare from the M dwarf AD Leo (Hawley and Pettersen, [@B30]) on an Earth-like planet located within its habitable zone.
RRTM	Rapid Radiative Transfer Model	The radiative-convective model is a hybrid of two models: a *δ* two-stream scattering model for reflected stellar radiation, and a more RRTM for thermal wavelengths.
O~3~	O~2~	For simulations containing multiple proton events, we limit the maximum NO (N) injected into the atmosphere by the amount of available reactant O~3~ in the atmospheric column.As a consequence of unfixing the mixing ratio of C, its abundance was increased in the stratosphere by methane oxidation (Yung and DeMore, [@B84]), as we will show in [Section 4.3](#s016){ref-type="sec"}.Rainout and saturation for the new unfixed species were also modified to be temperature dependent, and the appropriate Henry coefficients are shown in [Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"} along with the initial mixing ratios at the surface level of the atmospheric column.

NSAID	nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug	However, they should be taken in large amount for a long period of time due to the rather slow actions of these drugs, and thus there is a need for the development of improved drugs.One of the most commonly used methods of assessing the efficiency of gastritis treatment using an animal model is to introduce damage on the gastric mucosa by using NSAID or ethanol, and observe the rate of recovery.
bpd	barrels per day	Baghdad (AFP) - Iraq is to build a new pipeline to allow oil exports to resume from the northern province of Kirkuk to neighbouring Turkey, the oil ministry said Sunday.Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaybi has ordered documents to be prepared towards building the new pipeline to "transport crude oil from Kirkuk's oilfields to the port of Ceyhan" in Turkey, a ministry spokesman said in a statement.An older pipeline was "too damaged by attacks by Daesh terrorist gangs to be rehabilitated," Assem Jihad said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.Iraq had exported 250,000 to 400,000 bpd through that pipeline before IS jihadists swept across large parts of the country in 2014.The new pipeline is to stretch for around 250 kilometres (150 miles) from the area of Baiji, in the province of Salaheddine to the south of Kirkuk, to the Fishkhabur border post with Turkey further north.Earlier this month, the oil minister said Iraq aimed to double the output of Kirkuk oilfields to one million bpd after retaking the province from Kurdish forces in October.Iraqi government and paramilitary forces moved in to take over Kirkuk and its oilfields after Iraqi Kurds in September voted for independence in a controversial referendum opposed by Baghdad.Iraqi forces have driven IS fighters from all towns they once held in the country and are pressing a final push to flush them out from the western desert bordering Syria.

SM	Standard Model	'author:- 'Teng Ma, Bin Zhang'- Giacomo Cacciapagliatitle: 'Triplet with doubly-changed lepton at the LHC'---Introduction============Although the SM of electroweak interactions explains with great accuracy almost all of the available experimental data, there are good reasons to believe that it is not the ultimate theory to describe Nature.
1+y	1 dy\;	A simple loop calculation [@Feng:1999fu] leads to (keeping the leading term in an expansion for small $\lambda$): $$\begin{aligned}M_{X^-} - M_{X^{--}} &\sim& \lambda M_1 - \frac{\alpha_W M_1}{4 \pi} \left[ (3 \sin^2 \theta_W -1) (f(x_Z)-f(0)) + f(x_W) - f(0) \right]\,, \\M_{X^0} - M_{X^{--}} &\sim& 2 \lambda M_1 - \frac{\alpha_W M_1}{4 \pi} \left[ 4 \sin^2 \theta_W (f(x_Z)-f(0)) \right]\,.\end{aligned}$$ In the above formulas $\alpha_W = \alpha/\sin^2 \theta_W$, $x_W = m_W/M_1$, $x_Z = m_Z/M_1$, the loop function is given by $f (x) = 2 \int_0^ 1+y \log (y^2 + (1-y) x^2)$, and $f(0)$ is the contribution of the photon loop.

JNR	Japanese National Railways	The station was absorbed into the JR East network upon the privatization of the JNR on April 1, 1987.
FDA	Food and Drug Administration	The US FDA has approved the first US facility that can make cell-culture influenza vaccines, a Novartis plant in Holly Springs, N.C., that has been part of federal government efforts to prepare for a pandemic and to sidestep some limits of egg-based flu vaccine technology.Novartis said in a press release today that the approval clears the way for commercial production to begin at the site and for Flucelvax, its seasonal flu vaccine, to be made in the United States for the first time.
BARDA	Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority	The technology is designed to make production faster and more flexible, because the cells can be banked and there is no need for an egg supply.Development of the vaccine, underway since 2006, and construction of the Holly Springs facility have been a public-private partnership between Novartis and the BARDA, part of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

CIDRAP	Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy	So far no decision has been made to make a government-funded H7N9 vaccine.A comprehensive 2012 report on flu vaccines from a research team led by the University of Minnesota's CIDRAP, the publisher of CIDRAP News, said cell-based flu vaccine platforms could yield an incremental improvement in the vaccine production timeline and increase production volume.

DTP	diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis	Some observational studies found non-specific effects for all the routine childhood vaccines, and this allowed to perform some RCTs, that confirmed beneficial non-specific effects of the standard measles^[4](#CIT0004)^ and BCG vaccines^[5](#CIT0005),[6](#CIT0006)^, against sepsis and respiratory infections.On the contrary, DTP vaccine, although protective against the target diseases, increased female mortality from other infections^[7](#CIT0007)^.
IPV	inactivated polio vaccine	This could explain the increased female mortality in the above high-titer measles vaccine trials^[3](#CIT0003),[8](#CIT0008)^, in which inactivated DTP vaccine, or IPV for different children, were administered *after* the measles vaccine.Indeed, these effects may be persistent until the administration of another type of vaccine, and might last even longer.
SAGE	Strategic Advisory Group of Experts	These results support the hypotheses that DTP vaccine may have unfavorable effects, at least in low-income countries with high mortality from infections.The WHO SAGE^[11](#CIT0011)^ commissioned two systematic reviews^[12](#CIT0012),[13](#CIT0013)^, to decide if there was enough evidence to consider changes in scheduling of some vaccines.The first is a comprehensive epidemiological review^[12](#CIT0012)^, providing available data from RCTs, cohort and case-control studies on the impact of BCG, DPT, and MCV on non-specific and all-cause mortality in children aged under 5, excluding studies at "very high" risk of bias.
OPV	oral polio vaccine	If we fail to come together,... we will still be in the same situation when these systematic reviews are updated in five or even 10 years".Another interesting observational study, conducted from 1978 to 1983 on children undergoing DTP and OPV, was subsequently published^[15](#CIT0015)^.
MMR	mumps and rubella	However, if these effects are not investigated with appropriate studies, and they are strongly denied by the majority of scientific world and media, they will not come to light, even if they were present and not trivial.A recent nationwide population based cohort study in The Netherlands^[16](#CIT0016)^ examined whether measles, MMR vaccine had positive non-specific effects in a high-income setting.
AEs	adverse events	Only an *active* and accurate pharmacovigilance (with *solicited* , as it usually happens in the RCTs) allows to correctly quantify AEs or otherwise unexpected events.
AEFI	adverse event following {#S0001-S2003-S3001}#### Immunization	In the 2015, when were reported also the data from an RCT on a sample of children^[17](#CIT0017)^, the reported AEs were over 25 times than the average of the other Regions.### The WHO manual for the causality assessment of an AEFI {#S0001-S2003-S3001-S4001}Case reports, case series and pharmacovigilance reports are fundamental to detect rare adverse events (and sometimes even "uncommon" ones), since size and follow-up of RCTs are often insufficient to highlight less common events (however, if one arm of an RCT should show an excess of some events, it would be essential one would not ignore them, as it often happens^[18](#CIT0018)-[20](#CIT0020)^).Therefore, pharmacovigilance is essential to formulate *hypotheses*.

AP	AU-PRINCE, Haiti	/ Dieu Nalio Chery, APby USA TODAYby USA TODAYPORT- AP - Haiti is receiving $35.5 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to improve drinking water services in the Caribbean nation's gritty capital of Port-au-Prince.The grant will support a program created in 2010 with the help of the bank and the Spanish Cooperation Fund in Water and Sanitation in Latin American and the Caribbean.
CRC	Capital Research Center	According to SourceWatch, “One challenge, as Heritage saw it, was to counter the rise of its ideological opponents by whittling away their status as ‘public interest’ organisations and eliminating federal financial support for ‘liberal’ groups.”The CRC was founded in 1984 by a former Heritage Foundation vice president to implement this agenda by uncovering the presumably questionable funding sources of progressive groups.
ACORN	Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now	Banks have been pressured to change their lending practices or face ACORN charges of discrimination before regulators.’”ADVERTISEMENTCurrently, CRC senior editor Matthew Vadum — who describes himself as “America’s foremost expert on the ACORN” — seems to be carrying much of the weight of the anti-ACORN campaign through his blog, Twitter feed, and frequent appearances with Glenn Beck and other right-wing TV hosts.Last May, Vadum told Beck, “ACORN is an immense crime family … that has tentacles all though the United States, and now it’s trying to spread to India and Canada and other places.
ISI	Institute	At that time, however, the board was heavily loaded with individuals tied to both the Reagan administration and the Heritage Foundation, as well as to various other right-wing publications, think-tanks, and legal foundations.Although the evidence is skimpy, it suggests that many of the same people who were involved with CRC when it was founded in 1984 may have continued to be connected with the group and its ongoing agenda.One of the more interesting names on the 2001 list is that of T. Kenneth Cribb, Jr., a former Reagan adviser and president of the Intercollegiate Studies ISI.

HCV	hepatitis C virus	Introduction {#Sec1}============The HCV is a positive strand RNA virus.
nt	nucleotides	The genome consists of \~9600 nt and contains a single open reading frame (ORF), flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR).
ORF	open reading frame	The genome consists of \~9600 nucleotides (nt) and contains a single ORF, flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR).
UTR	untranslated region	The genome consists of \~9600 nucleotides (nt) and contains a single open reading frame (ORF), flanked by 5′ and 3′ UTR.
IRES	internal ribosome entry site	The 5′ UTR contains a set of secondary structures that compose the IRES, allowing a cap-independent translation of the viral genome.
NS	nonstructural	Cleavage of the resulting polyprotein by host and viral proteases gives rise to ten individual proteins, three structural proteins and seven NS proteins.
eIF2	eukaryotic initiation factor 2	DII can adopt an L-shaped tertiary structure, which is essential for IRES function as it mediates the displacement of eIF2 complex to facilitate attachment of the 60S ribosomal subunit.
RISC	RNA-induced silencing complex	miRs are incorporated into an RISC, with one of four Argonaute (AGO 1--4) proteins as the central element.
miR-122	microRNA-122	The 5′ end of the HCV viral genomic RNA features two conserved miR-122 target sites^[@CR8]^.
MBR	miR-122-binding region	Our in silico analysis predicted that the MBR has a negative effect on the formation of SLII, due to its additional *cis* functions in the complementary negative strand sequence.
NLuc	nanoluciferase	The first cistron consisted of HCV 5′ UTR (UTR1) harboring the cis-acting elements essential for RNA synthesis fused to a PV IRES allowing miR-122-independent translation of the NLuc gene.

CPC	College Personnel Committee	This formed the basis of the dean’s unwillingness to endorse the unanimous vote of the CPC for tenure and promotion.
FH	Faculty Handbook	This raises issues regarding what criteria are to be considered in tenure and promotion cases and whether “Vincentianism” or collegiality should factor into any consideration for tenure and/or promotion.Criteria for tenure and promotionGeneral criteria for tenure and promotion are stated in the university FH, in accord with AAUP [American Association of University Professors] criteria and guidelines for faculty peer reviews.
LAS P&T	LAS “College Promotion and Tenure Procedures”	There is no indication in this section about a fourth, and overriding, criterion: collegiality or “Vincentianism.”Collegiality and VincentianismIn addition to the university FH, the College of LAS P&T document offers three additional statements regarding criteria and process in its section 5 “Criteria” (LAS P&T, 5, p. 4).The first, 5.1, indicates that “The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences recruits and retains faculty who combine enthusiasm for teaching with a commitment to scholarship, research, and collegiality.”Significantly, the section elaborates only on the first three-teaching, scholarship, and research-and emphasizes the first as paramount.
LAS P&T	LAS’s “College Promotion and Tenure Procedures”	However, seen in light of its own and the AAUP statements regarding shifting academic priorities and financial exigency, the UBPT may act to “consider… any unusual implications the decision may have at the college/school or university level.” Again, both the FH and the AAUP statement assign primary rights and responsibilities for review criteria and evaluation to the home unit, and the AAUP considers any deviation from this process a possible violation of “inadequate consideration” and subject to “appeal.”Comment 2.3: The task force is very concerned about the inadequacies of the current College of LAS P&T document.There are serious gaps throughout the document, as well as loosely organized procedures.
CPC	College Personnel Committee	The dean’s recommendation, the recommendation and numerical vote of the personnel committee, along with the candidate’s supporting material are to be submitted to the executive vice president for academic affairs on or before the appropriate date as specified for a specific college or school…(FH, V, p.13).The college’s P&T document mentions the existence of the CPC in the “calendar” (1.2-1.4) and “procedures” (4.1) sections.

PCB	printed circuit board	The disclosure relates to a , and more particularly to a , which includes a circuit pattern having a curved surface in a portion of a lateral side thereof and a surface treatment layer formed through electrolytic plating, and a method of fabricating the same.A PCB, which is formed by printing a circuit line pattern on an electrically insulating substrate using a conductive material, such as copper (Cu), signifies a board immediately before electronic components are mounted thereon.
OSP	organic solderability preservative	That is to say, the PCB signifies a circuit board in which the mounting positions of the electronic components are determined, and circuit patterns are printed on and fixed to the surface of a flat plate to connect the electronic components with each other, in order to densely mount various types of electronic devices on the flat plate.In general, for the surface treatment of the circuit patterns formed on the PCB, OSP has been used, and electrolytic nickel/gold, electrolytic nickel/gold-cobalt alloy, or electroless nickel/palladium/gold has been used.In this case, various surface treatment schemes may be employed according to the use purposes thereof.
Ni	nickel	Accordingly, the protective layer 40 exposes at least a portion of the surface of the insulating layer 10 in the state that the protective layer 40 does not make contact with the circuit pattern 30.Meanwhile, the above PCB according to the related art includes the first surface treatment layer 50 including Ni and the second surface treatment layer 60 including gold (Au) for the surface treatment of the circuit pattern 30.In this case, the first surface treatment layer 50 and the second surface treatment layer 60 are generally formed through electroless plating since a seed layer for electroplating does not separately exist.In addition, to form the first and second surface treatment layers 50 and 60 through the electrolytic plating, a plating seed layer must be additionally formed.However, design limitations may exist as the additional seed layer is formed in order to perform the electroplating even though the surface treatment of the PCB is generally performed through the electroless plating.In addition, the surface treatment of the PCB essentially requires the formation of the first surface treatment layer 50 including metal, such as Ni, for the diffusion of the circuit pattern 30 including Cu.

BMCs	bone marrow-derived cells	Neural stem cells induce bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to generate neural stem-like cells via juxtacrine and paracrine interactions.Several recent reports suggest that there is far more plasticity that previously believed in the developmental potential of BMCs that can be induced by extracellular developmental signals of other lineages whose nature is still largely unknown.
MSCs	mesenchymal stem cells	In this study, we demonstrate that bone-marrow-derived MSCs co-cultured with mouse proliferating or fixed (by paraformaldehyde or methanol) neural stem cells (NSCs) generate neural stem cell-like cells with a higher expression of Sox-2 and nestin when grown in NS-A medium supplemented with N2, NSC conditioned medium (NSCcm) and bFGF.

PAP	People's Action Party	They also exercise powers over civil service appointments and national security matters.Political backgroundSingaporean politics have been dominated by the PAP since the 1959 general election when Lee Kuan Yew became Singapore's first prime minister (Singapore was then a self-governing state within the British Empire).
WP	Workers' Party	Freedom House deemed the press "not free" in 2015.Political climateDomination of the ruling partyThe WP is the main opposition party.
SDP	Singapore Democratic Party	Another major opposition party, the SDP, obtained no seats in the 2015 election.One commonly cited reason for a lack of opposition in Singapore is the use of defamation lawsuits by the PAP to bankrupt political opponents and disqualify them from running for office.
GRC	Group Representation Constituency	There have been accusations of gerrymandering via dissolving of constituencies with relatively stronger opposition support, such as the Cheng San GRC.Human rights conditionAlthough Singapore's laws are inherited from British and British Indian laws, including many elements of English common law, the PAP has also consistently rejected liberal democratic values, which it typifies as Western and states that there should not be a 'one-size-fits-all' solution to a democracy.
CEO	chief executive officer	He or she must have for a period of not less than three years held office — as Minister, Chief Justice, Speaker, Attorney-General, Chairman of the Public Service Commission, Auditor-General, Accountant-General or Permanent Secretary; as CEO of a key statutory board or government company: the Central Provident Fund Board, the Housing and Development Board, the Jurong Town Corporation, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Temasek Holdings, or GIC Private Limited (formerly known as the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation); as CEO of a company with an average of $500 million in shareholders' equity for the most recent three years in that office, and which is profitable after taxes; or in any other similar or comparable position of seniority and responsibility in any other organisation or department of equivalent size or complexity in the public or private sector which has given him such experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs as to enable him to carry out effectively the functions and duties of the office of President.The president now exercises powers over the following:appointment of public officersgovernment budgetsexamine government's exercise of its powers under the Internal Security Actexamine government's exercise of its powers under religious harmony lawsinvestigations into cases of corruptionHowever, the president must consult the Council of Presidential Advisers before he takes a decision on some of these matters.
GRCs	Group Representation Constituencies	The maximum term of any one parliament is five years, after which a general election must be held within three months of the dissolution of parliament.The 87 elected members of parliament (MPs) are elected on a plurality voting basis and represent either single-member constituencies (SMCs) or GRCs.
PAP	People's Action Party	In the general election in 2006, the incumbent PAP won 82 of the 84 seats, with the same configuration as the previous election in 2001, but with a loss of 9% of the popular vote.
ISA	Internal Security Act	The ISA is a legislation under such provision.
DPP	Democratic Progressive Party	Overall PAP saw its share of the vote fall to 66.6%.Opposition partiesThere is one opposition party in the 13th Parliament of Singapore as of 2016 - The Workers' Party.There are other parties such as the Progress Singapore Party, Singapore People's Party, Reform Party, and the DPP, that do not hold a seat in parliament.
NCMP	Non-Constituency MP	It also holds the remaining 3 NCMP seats.Women's participation in politicsWomen traditionally played a significantly smaller role than their male counterparts in Singapore.
WP	Workers' Party	Nonetheless, in recent years, there is an increasing level of female participation in the Singapore political arena.On 26 January 2013, Ms Lee Li Lian became the second woman from an opposition party to win a seat in Parliament by 3182 votes over the ruling party's candidate, Dr Koh Poh Koon, in a by-election in Punggol East, after Sylvia Lim Swee Lian, currently the Chairperson of the opposition WP and an elected Member of Parliament (MP) representing Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (Aljunied GRC) whose team won 54.71% of the votes (54.72% including overseas votes), the first time that an opposition party won a GRC since the system's introduction on 1 June 1988.

CMEs	coronal mass ejections	Kaneko and T. Yokoyama'title: | Simulation Study of Solar Plasma Eruptions Caused\ by Interactions between Emerging Flux and Coronal Arcade Fields---INTRODUCTION============Many kinds of eruptive phenomena, such as flares, filament eruptions and CMEs, can be seen in the solar atmosphere.
MHD	magnetohydrodynamic	It is widely believed that these eruptive phenomena are triggered by the same global MHD process by which free magnetic energy stored in the coronal magnetic field is released as a form of thermal and/or kinetic energy.Many models and theories about the triggers have been proposed from both observational and theoretical studies [@2011LRSP....8....1C], however, the exact mechanism by which eruptions occur is still under debates.
RS	reversed shear	When the location of the emerging flux surrounds the PIL of the co-arranged arcade, no current sheet forms between the arcade and emerging flux, resulting in an ‘unformed’ case.RC-type eruptions and ‘ RS-type eruptions, as observed in [@2012ApJ...760...31K], occur under similar conditions.

LFC	Low Framerate Compensation	G-Sync was said to handle low frame rates better than FreeSync, but a relatively new feature of FreeSync monitors is LFC, which promises smooth gaming down to 30 FPS or less.Response TimeA fast response time helps prevent problems such as blurring and ghosting and improves the gaming experience.So, what is the response time?We’ve already noted that, on a 60Hz monitor, the time gap between each frame is 16.67 milliseconds.
RTC	response time compensation	Manufacturers quote the fastest response time recorded in specifications, which is of limited use when judging real-world performance.Most modern LCD monitors use a technology called “ RTC or “overdrive” to accelerate the response time.
NAACP	National Association for the Advancement of Colored People	A panel of experts in Utah has recommended keeping the name of a popular hiking spot called Negro Bill canyon after receiving conflicting opinions about whether it is offensive.The Utah committee on geographic names said on Friday that a lack of consensus from minority groups led to its 8-2 vote on Thursday about a canyon in the eastern city of Moab, the gateway to stunning massive red rock formations.The local and national branches of the NAACP told the commission the name was not offensive and preserved the history of a canyon named for black rancher and prospector William Grandstaff, whose cattle grazed there in the 1870s.Jeanetta Williams, the local president of the NAACP, said the word “negro” may make some people feel uncomfortable but there was nothing wrong with it.

NHSVM	Normalized Hierarchical SVM	To amend these problems, we present the NHSVM.
y-y_i	y'=(y_i-y) \cup	Define normalized structural error $\tilde{\triangle}(y,y_i)$ $$\begin{aligned}\tilde{\triangle}(y,y_i)=\|\tilde{\wedge}(y)-\tilde{\wedge}(y_i)\|=\sqrt{\sum_{n\iny\triangle y_i} \alpha_n} \label{wserror}\end{aligned}$$ and $y\triangle y-y_i$ , and $\tilde{\wedge}(y)$ and $\alpha$ are defined in (\[nclassa\])(\[beta\_1\]).
NHSVM	Normalized Hierarchical SVM	This view of nonuniform margin gives a justification that the square root of hamming distance or tree induced distance is preferable than hamming distance.### modelSummarizing the above discussion, we propose the NHSVM, which is given in terms of the following objective: $$\begin{aligned}\min_W\lambda \underset{n}{\sum} \|W_n\|^2_2+ \underset{i}{\sum}\max_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} \sum_{n \in y}\sqrt{\alpha_n}W_n x_i - &\sum_{n \in y_i} \sqrt{\alpha_n}W_n x_i +\tilde{\triangle}(y,y_i) \label{NHSVM}\end{aligned}$$ Instead of imposing a weight for each node, with change of variables $U_n=\sqrt{\alpha_n}W_n$, we can write optimization (\[NHSVM\]) as changing regularization, $$\begin{aligned}\label{NHSVM2}\min_U\lambda \underset{n}{\sum} \dfrac{\|U_n\|^2_2}{\alpha_n}+ \underset{i}{\sum}\max_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} \sum_{n \in y}U_n x_i - &\sum_{n \in y_i} U_n x_i +\tilde{\triangle}(y,y_i)\end{aligned}$$ Also optimization is equivalently written as $$\begin{aligned}\min_W\lambda \|w\|^2_2+ \underset{i}{\sum}\max_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}w\cdot ((\tilde{\wedge}(y)-\tilde{\wedge}(y_i))\otimes x_i)+\tilde{\triangle}(y,y_i)% \}\end{aligned}$$ Note that for the single-label problem, normalized hierarchical SVM can be viewed as a multi-class SVM changing the feature map function to (\[nclassa\]) and the loss term to .
